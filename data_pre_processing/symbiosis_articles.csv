Gene Family Expansions Provide Molecular Flexibility Required for Context-Dependent Species Interactions.,"As environments worldwide change at unprecedented rates during the Anthropocene, understanding context dependency-how species interactions vary depending on environmental context-is crucial. Combining comparative genomics across 42 angiosperms with transcriptomics, genome-wide association mapping and gene duplication origin analyses, we show for the first time that gene family expansions are important to context-dependent regulation of species interactions. Gene families expanded in mycorrhizal fungi-associating plants display up to 200% more context-dependent gene expression and double the genetic variation associated with mycorrhizal benefits to plant fitness. Moreover, we discover these gene family expansions arise primarily from tandem duplications with >2-times more tandem duplications genome-wide, indicating gene family expansions continuously supply genetic variation, allowing fine-tuning of context dependency in species interactions throughout plant evolution. Taken together, our results spotlight how widespread gene duplications can provide molecular flexibility required for plant-microbial interactions to match changing environmental conditions.",40982385
Hi-C-resolved metagenomics reveals host range variation among mobile genetic elements within the European honey bee.,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and bacteriophages, are major contributors to the ecology and evolution of host-associated microbes due to symbiotic interactions and gene flow via horizontal gene transmission. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which are frequently trafficked via MGEs, are known to be enriched within North American honey bee microbiomes due to decades of antibiotic exposure. While previous studies have identified nearly identical MGE-associated ARGs across geographically disparate honey bee colonies, our understanding of how ARGs are distributed and mobilized within and between individual microbiomes is limited. To address this limitation, we leverage Hi-C-resolved metagenomics with the honey bee worker gut microbiome and show that the worker gut contains dense, nested, and highly distinct MGE communities. We show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Comparisons of individual microbiomes reveal highly individualized plasmid communities that exhibit broad host range variation within microbiomes. Finally, we provide specific evidence that antibiotic resistance cassettes are being actively shuttled between honey bee microbes via plasmids and that these broad host range plasmids frequently recombine to share gene content. Our work corroborates early observations of ARG dispersal in honey bee colonies and provides evidence for how these genes are mobilized within and across honey bee-associated microbial communities.IMPORTANCEMobile genetic elements (MGEs) are found in every microbial community and often encode genes conferring antibiotic resistance (ARGs). Within the honey bee worker gut microbiome, ARGs are particularly frequent due to decades of antibiotic exposure. Previous studies have identified nearly identical ARGs in geographically disparate honey bee colonies, which suggests recent mobilization by MGEs into these colonies, but identifying how these ARGs are mobilized and distributed within honey bee colonies remains a challenging task, as most techniques rely on microbial culture. Applying metagenomic Hi-C, we describe how these ARGs are distributed among individual plasmid backbones and how those plasmids are distributed among host microbial populations. Remarkably, we find plasmids exhibit broad host range variation, although they encode nearly identical ARGs. Our work corroborates earlier observations of ARG dispersal in honey bee colonies and provides further evidence for how these ARGs are mobilized across vast geographic distance.",40980884
Evolutionary Diversification and Functions of the Candidate Male Killing Gene wmk.,"Symbiont-mediated male killing (MK) is a mechanism that selectively eliminates male offspring, often by disrupting sex-specific developmental processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the WO-mediated killing gene wmk from Wolbachia prophage WO transgenically reproduces the MK phenotype, yet how the gene evolves and functions across diverse Wolbachia has not been systematically investigated. We analyzed 32 Wolbachia genomes available in the NCBI database to study wmk homologs across different arthropod hosts, reproductive parasitism functions, and Wolbachia supergroups. First, we report at least five distinct wmk phylogenetic clusters (Type I-V), often organized in multigenic dyads or triads. Second, among MK Wolbachia, there is a significantly higher number of wmk genes and diversity in Lepidoptera strains than in Drosophila strains, which exclusively harbor wmk Types I and III. Third, there are three patterns of wmk sequence and genomic organizational changes in Drosophila MK strains that associate with different evolutionary trajectories underpinning the MK phenotype. Fourth, single and combinatory transgenic expression of Types I and III in D. melanogaster uncovers male-biased lethality associated with Type I; however, dual expression of the Types together elicits a major reduction in offspring number. Fifth, wmk genes have low expression level across D. melanogaster developmental stages relative to the cifA and cifB genes, which could explain why cytoplasmic incompatibility is expressed in this system. These findings establish a complex and phylogenetically-informed genetic basis of wmk-induced lethality, highlighting the role of gene copy number and expression, wmk Types, and host background in shaping the phenotype.",40973632
Beyond plasmid addiction: the role of toxin-antitoxin systems in the selfish behavior of mobile genetic elements.,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were initially described as ""addiction"" modules that promote plasmid maintenance through a post-segregational killing (PSK) mechanism. In this process, the cells are forced to retain plasmids to avoid death caused by the longer half-life of the toxin compared to the antitoxin. However, TA systems have since been widely identified across a broad range of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting that TA systems support the maintenance of these MGEs within bacterial hosts and contribute to the exclusion of competing MGEs such as plasmids and phages. This perspective highlights their broader role beyond plasmid addiction, functioning as key components in safeguarding MGE persistence and enhancing MGE fitness. Therefore, the concept of ""plasmid addiction"" should be reconsidered as a subset of a more comprehensive phenomenon referred to as ""MGE selfishness,"" which more accurately captures the widespread distribution and conserved, self-serving functions of TA systems across diverse MGEs. Additionally, TA systems facilitate the establishment of MGEs as ""molecular symbionts"" within bacterial cells. While initially considered parasitic, the relationships can evolve to provide mutual benefits for both the MGE and the host. From a gene-centered evolutionary perspective, the proposed molecular symbiosis may progress to a point where most of the MGE's original content is lost, leaving only essential genes that are retained and functionally co-opted by the host. Further studies should investigate the role of TA systems in MGEs beyond plasmids, as well as their evolutionary trajectories toward specialized functions that may influence the adaptation and evolution of key bacterial groups, including pathogens.",40970722
Selective shaping of prokaryotic communities and core symbiont maintenance suggest large-scale aquarium facilities as reservoirs of microbiome diversity in octocorals.,"Octocorals play a critical role in coral ecosystems, contributing to habitat complexity and marine biodiversity. Despite their ecological importance, the microbial communities associated with octocorals remain understudied, particularly under ex situ conditions. This study compared the prokaryotic communities of the tropical octocoral <i>Litophyton</i> sp., surrounding seawater, and sediments (""biotopes"") from a natural Red Sea reef and a long-term tropical aquarium mesocosm designed to emulate natural reef ecosystems (""habitats""). Using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed community composition, diversity, and core taxa. Distinct prokaryotic assemblages were associated with each biotope, with core symbionts persisting across habitats. While seawater communities diverged between habitats, sediment communities were compositionally more similar, dominated by <i>Nitrosopumilaceae</i>, <i>Pirellulaceae</i>, <i>Woeseiaceae</i>, and <i>Flavobacteriaceae</i>. <i>Litophyton</i> sp. harbored specific symbionts consistently across habitats. Alpha-diversity in <i>Litophyton</i> sp. did not differ significantly between habitats (ANOVA with Tukey's HSD, <i>p</i>>0.05), and beta-diversity patterns were also not significant (PERMANOVA, <i>p</i>>0.05). We identified 19 ASVs shared across <i>Litophyton</i> sp. habitats, dominated by <i>Endozoicomonas</i>, unclassified <i>Campylobacterales</i>, and <i>Marivibrio</i>. Several core families, such as <i>Endozoicomonadaceae</i>, <i>Spirochaetaceae</i>, and <i>Kiloniellaceae</i> were consistently associated with <i>Litophyton</i> sp. across habitats, indicating stability of specific host-microbe associations even after 25years in aquarium conditions. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated the selective maintenance of diverse <i>Endozoicomonas</i> lineages in aquarium-kept <i>Litophyton</i> specimens. These findings suggest that large-scale aquarium ecosystems can preserve, to some extent, the structure and diversity of coral-associated microbiomes over extended time periods. By supporting key symbiotic taxa, multi-trophic integrated aquarium systems may serve as repositories for healthy coral-associated microbial communities and microbiome stewardship, underscoring their value in future conservation efforts to sustain the biodiversity of marine holobionts in the face of growing environmental challenges.",40969425
Genetic Insights Into Pathways Supporting Optimized Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Chickpea and Their Interaction With Disease Resistance Breeding.,"In chickpea (Cicer arietinum), a globally important grain legume, improvements in yield stability are required to address food security and agricultural land loss. One approach is to improve both nutrient acquisition through symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria and biotic stress resistance. To support the simultaneous selection of multiple beneficial traits, we sought to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes linked to improved plant-microbe symbiosis both under symbiosis-promotive growth conditions and when pathogens are present. Our aims were to use the chickpea-Mesorhizobium rhizobial model to identify QTL associated with biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and nutrient acquisition and understand factors promotive of sustained BNF under biotic stress through the impact of Phytophthora root rot (PRR) on BNF across chickpea genotypes on host gene expression. Using two chickpeaC. echinospermum recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, we identified QTL associated with BNF and several associated with macro- and micro-nutrient status of chickpea. From within a set of the most PRR-resistant RIL (n=70), we successfully identified RIL with both high PRR resistance and N sourced from BNF. In conditions of the tripartite (host:rhizobia:pathogen) interaction, while there was no consistent pathogen impact on the abundance of Mesorhizobium in nodules, PRR-resistant genotypes maintained a higher activity of their N-assimilation genes, while susceptible genotypes repressed these genes. This improved understanding of the genetic support of BNF in chickpea will allow selection for material that maintains higher BNF and is more disease resistant, which together may improve yield stability in chickpea.",40962294
Impact of sublethal zinc exposure on ectomycorrhizal <i>Laccaria bicolor</i> x poplar symbiosis.,"Soil Zn pollution is a widespread problem that is impacting on plant growth and production. Several tree species can rely on fungal ectomycorrhizal symbionts to mitigate toxicity effects to some extent. Here, we explored the impact of Zn pollution on <i>L. bicolor</i> and its ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with <i>Populus tremula x alba</i>. Next to growth and morphological parameters in sublethal Zn exposure, we investigated responses of symbiosis marker genes, reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes and Zn transporters in presence and absence of a host plant. Our results indicate that the ECM symbiosis development is maintained in excess Zn conditions despite a reduction in fungal and plant growth. Symbiosis marker gene expression showed sensitivity to Zn excess, even when the fungus was cultured in absence of a host. Zn-induced transcriptional responses of ROS scavenging enzymes and Zn transporters were mainly restricted to mycelia in presence of a host and less prevalent without host. Establishment of new homeostatic equilibria, in particular in presence of a host, seem essential to maintain symbiosis, protect the host and adapt physiologically to Zn pollution. This research furthers our understanding of how resilient plant-fungal symbiotic interactions are, and the interplay between both partners in changing environmental conditions.",40959553
Argyrolobium legumes from an African centre of endemism associate with novel Bradyrhizobium species harbouring unique sets of symbiosis genes.,"Given that several, mainly endemic South African Genisteae genera occupy basal positions in legume phylogenetic trees, this region of Africa is considered a primaeval centre of diversification of this legume tribe. Despite the importance of South Africa in Genisteae evolution, almost all studies have focused on rhizobia nodulating Genisteae in their centres of diversity in either the Mediterranean Basin or the Americas. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and characterize rhizobial strains associated with Argyrolobium species native to areas of the Grassland biome associated with the Great Escarpment, which dominates the subcontinent's eastern landscape, and compare these to bradyrhizobia nodulating Genisteae in other centres of diversity. Phylogenetic analyses of five housekeeping genes (dnaK, glnII, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) separated the 18 Bradyrhizobium strains examined into five well-supported groups. Three of these were conspecific with B. arachidis, B. brasilense/B. australafricanum and B. ivorense, while the remaining two appeared to be new to science. After confirming their novelty using Average Nucleotide Identity, a metric for genome relatedness, and certain phenotypic traits, we recognized them as novel species for which we proposed the names B. spitzkopense sp. nov. (Arg816<sup>Ts</sup>) and B. mpumalangense sp. nov. (Arg237L<sup>Ts</sup>). Phylogenetic analyses of nodA gene sequences showed that about half of the strains examined, irrespective of their species identity, harboured alleles known only from the Grassland biome along the Great Escarpment that were previously detected in Bradyrhizobium strains nodulating Crotalarieae endemic to this region. Genome-based analyses of data from this and previous studies further showed that strains with these unique nodA alleles typically encode the nodH gene, the product of which adds a sulfate moiety to the Nod factor (the signalling molecule for establishing the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis). The remaining strains had nodA alleles commonly encountered elsewhere in South Africa and other tropical regions of the world. Also, the genomes of these other strains lacked nodH but encoded nodZ, the gene involved in the fucosylation of the Nod factor. Our findings, therefore, showed that the root nodules of Genisteae (and its sister tribe Crotalarieae) native to the Grassland biome along the Great Escarpment are often related Bradyrhizobium strains that are distinct from bradyrhizobia nodulating Genisteae in the Mediterranean and the Americas.",40957508
A chromosome-level genome assembly of Termitomyces fuliginosus using Oxford Nanopore and Hi-C sequencing.,"Termitomyces fuliginosus is a tasty edible mushroom with both nutritional and medicinal values, consumed by native people throughout Asia. However, studies about this mushroom are limited due to lack of fine genomic information, such as the molecular mechanisms underlying development, symbiosis with termites, and plant biomass degradation. In this study, we reported a chromosome-level reference genome of T. fuliginosus assembled using Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) and Hi-C technologies. In total, the clean data obtained from ONT and Hi-C sequencing amounted to 10.42 Gb and 21.75 Gb, respectively. The assembled genome consisted of 13 chromosomes with a total length of 65.66Mb. Completeness evaluations showed that this assembled genome had high quality, with a complete BUSCO score of 91.6%. In total, 10,319 protein-coding genes were identified, and each gene received at least one functional annotation hit across the queried databases. Based on single-copy orthologous genes, phylogenetic analysis revealed that T. fuliginosus shared a close evolutionary relationship with Termitomyces cryptogamus, Arthromyces matolae, Tricholoma furcatifolium, Tephrocybe rancida, Lyophyllum atratum, and Tricholoma matsutake. A total of 303 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) genes were identified in the T. fuliginosus genome, enabling a better understanding of the carbohydrate degradation capabilities for T. fuliginosus. This chromosome-level genome of T. fuliginosus provides valuable reference data for utilizing the medicinal and nutritional value of this mushroom, such as accurate genomic sequences without gaps, genomic analysis of functional genes, and visualization of chromosomal structural variations.",40945623
Exogenous Application of ENOD40 and CEP1 Peptides Boosts Symbiotic Signaling Gene Expression and Productivity in Common Bean.,"Small signaling peptides play crucial roles in the regulation of legume-rhizobia symbiosis, yet their potential as exogenous biostimulants remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the effects of foliar application of the synthetic peptides ENOD40 and CEP1 on common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) under both greenhouse and field conditions. Using a factorial design, we examined gene expression patterns, nodulation parameters, and yield-related traits in response to peptide treatments alone or in combination with <i>Rhizobium</i>. Results showed that ENOD40 and CEP1 significantly enhanced the transcription of key symbiotic signaling genes (<i>PvENOD40</i>, <i>PvSYMRK</i>, <i>PvCCaMK</i>, <i>PvCYCLOPS</i>, <i>PvVAPYRIN</i>) and modulated defense-related genes (<i>PvAOS</i>, <i>PvICS</i>), with the strongest effects observed at concentrations of 10<sup>-7</sup> M and 10<sup>-8</sup> M. In greenhouse assays, peptide-treated plants exhibited increased root and shoot biomass, nodule number, and seed yield. Field trials confirmed these responses, with CEP1 10<sup>-7</sup> M + <i>Rhizobium</i> treatment achieving the highest grain yield (3322 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). Our findings provide the first evidence that ENOD40 and CEP1 peptides can function as foliar-applied biostimulants to enhance nodulation efficiency and improve yield in legumes. This approach offers a promising and sustainable strategy to reduce chemical nitrogen inputs and support biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems.",40941956
