"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Gene Family Expansions Provide Molecular Flexibility Required for Context-Dependent Species Interactions.,"As environments worldwide change at unprecedented rates during the Anthropocene, understanding context dependency-how species interactions vary depending on environmental context-is crucial. Combining comparative genomics across 42 angiosperms with transcriptomics, genome-wide association mapping and gene duplication origin analyses, we show for the first time that gene family expansions are important to context-dependent regulation of species interactions. Gene families expanded in mycorrhizal fungi-associating plants display up to 200% more context-dependent gene expression and double the genetic variation associated with mycorrhizal benefits to plant fitness. Moreover, we discover these gene family expansions arise primarily from tandem duplications with >2-times more tandem duplications genome-wide, indicating gene family expansions continuously supply genetic variation, allowing fine-tuning of context dependency in species interactions throughout plant evolution. Taken together, our results spotlight how widespread gene duplications can provide molecular flexibility required for plant-microbial interactions to match changing environmental conditions.",40982385
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Hi-C-resolved metagenomics reveals host range variation among mobile genetic elements within the European honey bee.,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and bacteriophages, are major contributors to the ecology and evolution of host-associated microbes due to symbiotic interactions and gene flow via horizontal gene transmission. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which are frequently trafficked via MGEs, are known to be enriched within North American honey bee microbiomes due to decades of antibiotic exposure. While previous studies have identified nearly identical MGE-associated ARGs across geographically disparate honey bee colonies, our understanding of how ARGs are distributed and mobilized within and between individual microbiomes is limited. To address this limitation, we leverage Hi-C-resolved metagenomics with the honey bee worker gut microbiome and show that the worker gut contains dense, nested, and highly distinct MGE communities. We show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Comparisons of individual microbiomes reveal highly individualized plasmid communities that exhibit broad host range variation within microbiomes. Finally, we provide specific evidence that antibiotic resistance cassettes are being actively shuttled between honey bee microbes via plasmids and that these broad host range plasmids frequently recombine to share gene content. Our work corroborates early observations of ARG dispersal in honey bee colonies and provides evidence for how these genes are mobilized within and across honey bee-associated microbial communities.IMPORTANCEMobile genetic elements (MGEs) are found in every microbial community and often encode genes conferring antibiotic resistance (ARGs). Within the honey bee worker gut microbiome, ARGs are particularly frequent due to decades of antibiotic exposure. Previous studies have identified nearly identical ARGs in geographically disparate honey bee colonies, which suggests recent mobilization by MGEs into these colonies, but identifying how these ARGs are mobilized and distributed within honey bee colonies remains a challenging task, as most techniques rely on microbial culture. Applying metagenomic Hi-C, we describe how these ARGs are distributed among individual plasmid backbones and how those plasmids are distributed among host microbial populations. Remarkably, we find plasmids exhibit broad host range variation, although they encode nearly identical ARGs. Our work corroborates earlier observations of ARG dispersal in honey bee colonies and provides further evidence for how these ARGs are mobilized across vast geographic distance.",40980884
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary Diversification and Functions of the Candidate Male Killing Gene wmk.,"Symbiont-mediated male killing (MK) is a mechanism that selectively eliminates male offspring, often by disrupting sex-specific developmental processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the WO-mediated killing gene wmk from Wolbachia prophage WO transgenically reproduces the MK phenotype, yet how the gene evolves and functions across diverse Wolbachia has not been systematically investigated. We analyzed 32 Wolbachia genomes available in the NCBI database to study wmk homologs across different arthropod hosts, reproductive parasitism functions, and Wolbachia supergroups. First, we report at least five distinct wmk phylogenetic clusters (Type I-V), often organized in multigenic dyads or triads. Second, among MK Wolbachia, there is a significantly higher number of wmk genes and diversity in Lepidoptera strains than in Drosophila strains, which exclusively harbor wmk Types I and III. Third, there are three patterns of wmk sequence and genomic organizational changes in Drosophila MK strains that associate with different evolutionary trajectories underpinning the MK phenotype. Fourth, single and combinatory transgenic expression of Types I and III in D. melanogaster uncovers male-biased lethality associated with Type I; however, dual expression of the Types together elicits a major reduction in offspring number. Fifth, wmk genes have low expression level across D. melanogaster developmental stages relative to the cifA and cifB genes, which could explain why cytoplasmic incompatibility is expressed in this system. These findings establish a complex and phylogenetically-informed genetic basis of wmk-induced lethality, highlighting the role of gene copy number and expression, wmk Types, and host background in shaping the phenotype.",40973632
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Beyond plasmid addiction: the role of toxin-antitoxin systems in the selfish behavior of mobile genetic elements.,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were initially described as ""addiction"" modules that promote plasmid maintenance through a post-segregational killing (PSK) mechanism. In this process, the cells are forced to retain plasmids to avoid death caused by the longer half-life of the toxin compared to the antitoxin. However, TA systems have since been widely identified across a broad range of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting that TA systems support the maintenance of these MGEs within bacterial hosts and contribute to the exclusion of competing MGEs such as plasmids and phages. This perspective highlights their broader role beyond plasmid addiction, functioning as key components in safeguarding MGE persistence and enhancing MGE fitness. Therefore, the concept of ""plasmid addiction"" should be reconsidered as a subset of a more comprehensive phenomenon referred to as ""MGE selfishness,"" which more accurately captures the widespread distribution and conserved, self-serving functions of TA systems across diverse MGEs. Additionally, TA systems facilitate the establishment of MGEs as ""molecular symbionts"" within bacterial cells. While initially considered parasitic, the relationships can evolve to provide mutual benefits for both the MGE and the host. From a gene-centered evolutionary perspective, the proposed molecular symbiosis may progress to a point where most of the MGE's original content is lost, leaving only essential genes that are retained and functionally co-opted by the host. Further studies should investigate the role of TA systems in MGEs beyond plasmids, as well as their evolutionary trajectories toward specialized functions that may influence the adaptation and evolution of key bacterial groups, including pathogens.",40970722
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Selective shaping of prokaryotic communities and core symbiont maintenance suggest large-scale aquarium facilities as reservoirs of microbiome diversity in octocorals.,"Octocorals play a critical role in coral ecosystems, contributing to habitat complexity and marine biodiversity. Despite their ecological importance, the microbial communities associated with octocorals remain understudied, particularly under ex situ conditions. This study compared the prokaryotic communities of the tropical octocoral <i>Litophyton</i> sp., surrounding seawater, and sediments (""biotopes"") from a natural Red Sea reef and a long-term tropical aquarium mesocosm designed to emulate natural reef ecosystems (""habitats""). Using high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed community composition, diversity, and core taxa. Distinct prokaryotic assemblages were associated with each biotope, with core symbionts persisting across habitats. While seawater communities diverged between habitats, sediment communities were compositionally more similar, dominated by <i>Nitrosopumilaceae</i>, <i>Pirellulaceae</i>, <i>Woeseiaceae</i>, and <i>Flavobacteriaceae</i>. <i>Litophyton</i> sp. harbored specific symbionts consistently across habitats. Alpha-diversity in <i>Litophyton</i> sp. did not differ significantly between habitats (ANOVA with Tukey's HSD, <i>p</i>>0.05), and beta-diversity patterns were also not significant (PERMANOVA, <i>p</i>>0.05). We identified 19 ASVs shared across <i>Litophyton</i> sp. habitats, dominated by <i>Endozoicomonas</i>, unclassified <i>Campylobacterales</i>, and <i>Marivibrio</i>. Several core families, such as <i>Endozoicomonadaceae</i>, <i>Spirochaetaceae</i>, and <i>Kiloniellaceae</i> were consistently associated with <i>Litophyton</i> sp. across habitats, indicating stability of specific host-microbe associations even after 25years in aquarium conditions. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated the selective maintenance of diverse <i>Endozoicomonas</i> lineages in aquarium-kept <i>Litophyton</i> specimens. These findings suggest that large-scale aquarium ecosystems can preserve, to some extent, the structure and diversity of coral-associated microbiomes over extended time periods. By supporting key symbiotic taxa, multi-trophic integrated aquarium systems may serve as repositories for healthy coral-associated microbial communities and microbiome stewardship, underscoring their value in future conservation efforts to sustain the biodiversity of marine holobionts in the face of growing environmental challenges.",40969425
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Genetic Insights Into Pathways Supporting Optimized Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Chickpea and Their Interaction With Disease Resistance Breeding.,"In chickpea (Cicer arietinum), a globally important grain legume, improvements in yield stability are required to address food security and agricultural land loss. One approach is to improve both nutrient acquisition through symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria and biotic stress resistance. To support the simultaneous selection of multiple beneficial traits, we sought to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genes linked to improved plant-microbe symbiosis both under symbiosis-promotive growth conditions and when pathogens are present. Our aims were to use the chickpea-Mesorhizobium rhizobial model to identify QTL associated with biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and nutrient acquisition and understand factors promotive of sustained BNF under biotic stress through the impact of Phytophthora root rot (PRR) on BNF across chickpea genotypes on host gene expression. Using two chickpeaC. echinospermum recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, we identified QTL associated with BNF and several associated with macro- and micro-nutrient status of chickpea. From within a set of the most PRR-resistant RIL (n=70), we successfully identified RIL with both high PRR resistance and N sourced from BNF. In conditions of the tripartite (host:rhizobia:pathogen) interaction, while there was no consistent pathogen impact on the abundance of Mesorhizobium in nodules, PRR-resistant genotypes maintained a higher activity of their N-assimilation genes, while susceptible genotypes repressed these genes. This improved understanding of the genetic support of BNF in chickpea will allow selection for material that maintains higher BNF and is more disease resistant, which together may improve yield stability in chickpea.",40962294
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Impact of sublethal zinc exposure on ectomycorrhizal <i>Laccaria bicolor</i> x poplar symbiosis.,"Soil Zn pollution is a widespread problem that is impacting on plant growth and production. Several tree species can rely on fungal ectomycorrhizal symbionts to mitigate toxicity effects to some extent. Here, we explored the impact of Zn pollution on <i>L. bicolor</i> and its ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with <i>Populus tremula x alba</i>. Next to growth and morphological parameters in sublethal Zn exposure, we investigated responses of symbiosis marker genes, reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes and Zn transporters in presence and absence of a host plant. Our results indicate that the ECM symbiosis development is maintained in excess Zn conditions despite a reduction in fungal and plant growth. Symbiosis marker gene expression showed sensitivity to Zn excess, even when the fungus was cultured in absence of a host. Zn-induced transcriptional responses of ROS scavenging enzymes and Zn transporters were mainly restricted to mycelia in presence of a host and less prevalent without host. Establishment of new homeostatic equilibria, in particular in presence of a host, seem essential to maintain symbiosis, protect the host and adapt physiologically to Zn pollution. This research furthers our understanding of how resilient plant-fungal symbiotic interactions are, and the interplay between both partners in changing environmental conditions.",40959553
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Argyrolobium legumes from an African centre of endemism associate with novel Bradyrhizobium species harbouring unique sets of symbiosis genes.,"Given that several, mainly endemic South African Genisteae genera occupy basal positions in legume phylogenetic trees, this region of Africa is considered a primaeval centre of diversification of this legume tribe. Despite the importance of South Africa in Genisteae evolution, almost all studies have focused on rhizobia nodulating Genisteae in their centres of diversity in either the Mediterranean Basin or the Americas. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and characterize rhizobial strains associated with Argyrolobium species native to areas of the Grassland biome associated with the Great Escarpment, which dominates the subcontinent's eastern landscape, and compare these to bradyrhizobia nodulating Genisteae in other centres of diversity. Phylogenetic analyses of five housekeeping genes (dnaK, glnII, gyrB, recA, and rpoB) separated the 18 Bradyrhizobium strains examined into five well-supported groups. Three of these were conspecific with B. arachidis, B. brasilense/B. australafricanum and B. ivorense, while the remaining two appeared to be new to science. After confirming their novelty using Average Nucleotide Identity, a metric for genome relatedness, and certain phenotypic traits, we recognized them as novel species for which we proposed the names B. spitzkopense sp. nov. (Arg816<sup>Ts</sup>) and B. mpumalangense sp. nov. (Arg237L<sup>Ts</sup>). Phylogenetic analyses of nodA gene sequences showed that about half of the strains examined, irrespective of their species identity, harboured alleles known only from the Grassland biome along the Great Escarpment that were previously detected in Bradyrhizobium strains nodulating Crotalarieae endemic to this region. Genome-based analyses of data from this and previous studies further showed that strains with these unique nodA alleles typically encode the nodH gene, the product of which adds a sulfate moiety to the Nod factor (the signalling molecule for establishing the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis). The remaining strains had nodA alleles commonly encountered elsewhere in South Africa and other tropical regions of the world. Also, the genomes of these other strains lacked nodH but encoded nodZ, the gene involved in the fucosylation of the Nod factor. Our findings, therefore, showed that the root nodules of Genisteae (and its sister tribe Crotalarieae) native to the Grassland biome along the Great Escarpment are often related Bradyrhizobium strains that are distinct from bradyrhizobia nodulating Genisteae in the Mediterranean and the Americas.",40957508
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",A chromosome-level genome assembly of Termitomyces fuliginosus using Oxford Nanopore and Hi-C sequencing.,"Termitomyces fuliginosus is a tasty edible mushroom with both nutritional and medicinal values, consumed by native people throughout Asia. However, studies about this mushroom are limited due to lack of fine genomic information, such as the molecular mechanisms underlying development, symbiosis with termites, and plant biomass degradation. In this study, we reported a chromosome-level reference genome of T. fuliginosus assembled using Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) and Hi-C technologies. In total, the clean data obtained from ONT and Hi-C sequencing amounted to 10.42 Gb and 21.75 Gb, respectively. The assembled genome consisted of 13 chromosomes with a total length of 65.66Mb. Completeness evaluations showed that this assembled genome had high quality, with a complete BUSCO score of 91.6%. In total, 10,319 protein-coding genes were identified, and each gene received at least one functional annotation hit across the queried databases. Based on single-copy orthologous genes, phylogenetic analysis revealed that T. fuliginosus shared a close evolutionary relationship with Termitomyces cryptogamus, Arthromyces matolae, Tricholoma furcatifolium, Tephrocybe rancida, Lyophyllum atratum, and Tricholoma matsutake. A total of 303 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) genes were identified in the T. fuliginosus genome, enabling a better understanding of the carbohydrate degradation capabilities for T. fuliginosus. This chromosome-level genome of T. fuliginosus provides valuable reference data for utilizing the medicinal and nutritional value of this mushroom, such as accurate genomic sequences without gaps, genomic analysis of functional genes, and visualization of chromosomal structural variations.",40945623
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Exogenous Application of ENOD40 and CEP1 Peptides Boosts Symbiotic Signaling Gene Expression and Productivity in Common Bean.,"Small signaling peptides play crucial roles in the regulation of legume-rhizobia symbiosis, yet their potential as exogenous biostimulants remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the effects of foliar application of the synthetic peptides ENOD40 and CEP1 on common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) under both greenhouse and field conditions. Using a factorial design, we examined gene expression patterns, nodulation parameters, and yield-related traits in response to peptide treatments alone or in combination with <i>Rhizobium</i>. Results showed that ENOD40 and CEP1 significantly enhanced the transcription of key symbiotic signaling genes (<i>PvENOD40</i>, <i>PvSYMRK</i>, <i>PvCCaMK</i>, <i>PvCYCLOPS</i>, <i>PvVAPYRIN</i>) and modulated defense-related genes (<i>PvAOS</i>, <i>PvICS</i>), with the strongest effects observed at concentrations of 10<sup>-7</sup> M and 10<sup>-8</sup> M. In greenhouse assays, peptide-treated plants exhibited increased root and shoot biomass, nodule number, and seed yield. Field trials confirmed these responses, with CEP1 10<sup>-7</sup> M + <i>Rhizobium</i> treatment achieving the highest grain yield (3322 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). Our findings provide the first evidence that ENOD40 and CEP1 peptides can function as foliar-applied biostimulants to enhance nodulation efficiency and improve yield in legumes. This approach offers a promising and sustainable strategy to reduce chemical nitrogen inputs and support biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems.",40941956
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Identification of a Sinorhizobium meliloti YbgC-like thioesterase that contributes to the production of the infochemical 2-tridecanone.,"Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that can establish beneficial symbiosis with legume plants. The fadD gene encodes a long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase. Inactivation of FadD in S. meliloti leads to a pleiotropic phenotype, including the overproduction of several volatile methylketones (MKs). One of them, 2-tridecanone (2-TDC), was found to act as an infochemical that affects important bacterial traits and hampers plant-bacteria interactions. Knowledge about bacterial genes involved in MK production is limited. In wild tomato species, MK synthesis requires intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis and the activity of the methylketone synthase 2 (MKS2), a thioesterase belonging to the hotdog-fold family. In this study, we have identified SMc03960, a conserved hypothetical protein with homology to bacterial YbgC-like thioesterases, as an ortholog of MKS2 in S. meliloti. Heterologous expression of smc03960 in Escherichia coli results in the formation of several MKs, including 2-TDC, and causes the accumulation of free fatty acids. Purified His-SMc03960 showed thioesterase activity for different acyl groups linked either to acyl carrier protein (ACP) or to CoA with preference for C14-long substrates. Moreover, formation of 2-TDC in vitro was achieved by using His-SMc03960 and 3-oxo-myristoyl-ACP. Although deletion of smc03960 in the wild type or in the fadD mutant does not significantly alter the amount of MKs released by S. meliloti, overexpression of the gene results in increased production of 2-TDC in these two strains. Overall, our data demonstrate that SMc03960 is an acyl-ACP/acyl-CoA thioesterase with broad substrate specificity that contributes to 2-TDC formation.",40938124
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",The effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the growth of wheat seedlings with contrasting phosphorus use efficiencies under low phosphorus stress.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can stimulate root development in plants and enhance their ability to adapt to stress conditions. This study investigated the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on the growth, hormone dynamics, and phosphorus (P) metabolism of two wheat cultivars with differing phosphorus utilization efficiencies under both normal and low phosphorus concentration conditions. The research focused on the symbiotic interaction between AMF and these wheat varieties to elucidate their responses to varying phosphorus availability. The experiment showed that phosphorus inefficient wheat SW14 inoculated with AMF for 30 days under low phosphorus stress showed significant enhancement in plant height, biomass, leaf width, stem thickness, root surface area, and vegetative phosphorus content, while total root length and primary root length were reduced, This change in root length was attributed to the fact that the root system undergoes elongation and growth to adapt to the adversity under low phosphorus stress in crops, and inoculation with AMF effectively alleviated the extent of this low phosphorus stress. while IAA, SL, cellulose and lignin hormone levels and APC enzyme activities were significantly elevated, and stem structure was significantly optimized; whereas, the phosphorus-efficient variety, SW2, did not show significant improvement due to its own unique tolerance to low phosphorus stress (Table2). Transcriptomic profiling identified 2,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs: 983/1,517), enriched in ABC transporters (ko02010), Plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075), and MAPK signaling pathway - plant (ko04016), Cutin, suberin and wax biosynthesis(ko00073). WGCNA further resolved that AMF responded to low phosphorus stress by up-regulating the expression of cellulose, lignin, APC synthesis, and IAA/SL-related genes in SW14, with the most relevant phenotypes shown to correlate to primary root length, total root length, root dry weight and stem diameter. AMF inoculation significantly enhanced growth and dry matter accumulation in the low-phosphorus-use-efficiency wheat variety SW14 under phosphorus-deficient stress. This treatment concurrently stimulated IAA, SL, and APC activities, resulting in increased phosphorus uptake/accumulation, notable accumulation of cellulose and lignin, and consequently significantly improved stem strength. Although AMF inoculation improved growth in the high-phosphorus-use-efficiency wheat variety SW2, these enhancements failed to reach statistical significance.",40936089
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Detection of Wolbachia in Natural Populations of Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) Infesting Argan Fruits in Morocco.,"The argan tree (Argania spinosa L. Skeels), native to the sub-Saharan region of Morocco, is an endangered agroforestry species renowned for producing one of the world's most expensive and sought-after oils. However, this valuable resource is threatened by the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata (Wied.)), an invasive pest worldwide. Like other dipteran insects, C. capitata has developed mutualistic interactions with prokaryotic endosymbionts, including Wolbachia, a facultative intracellular bacterium that could play a role in the biology of this pest. Between 2022 and 2024, a field survey was conducted in the argan forests of Agadir, southern Morocco, to detect Wolbachia in natural populations of C. capitata and investigate its potential impact on this pest. A total of eighteen wild type specimens were captured to investigate the endosymbionts of this insect pest. Detection of Wolbachia was carried out by PCR using a primer pair targeting a specific fragment within the cox gene. Amplicons of the expected size were sequenced in both directions, and one sequence was deposited in the GenBank under accession Number PQ285444. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained sequence belongs to the monophyletic clade of the Wolbachia B supergroup, known to infect a variety of insect species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the bacterium being detected and characterized in natural populations of the Mediterranean fruit fly infesting argan fruits in the country. These findings open new perspectives for integrated biological control strategies, offering a sustainable alternative to chemical insecticides for managing this insect pest species in Morocco.",40931264
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Horizontal Gene Transfer and Recombination in Cyanobacteriota.,"Cyanobacteria played a pivotal role in shaping Earth's early history and today are key players in many ecosystems. As versatile and ubiquitous phototrophs, they are used as models for oxygenic photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, circadian rhythms, symbiosis, and adaptations to harsh environments. Cyanobacterial genomes and metagenomes exhibit high levels of genomic diversity partly driven by gene flow within and across species. Processes such as recombination and horizontal transfer of novel genes are facilitated by the mobilome that includes plasmids, transposable elements, and bacteriophages. We review these processes in the context of molecular mechanisms of gene transfer, barriers to gene flow, selection for novel traits, and auxiliary metabolic genes. Additionally, Cyanobacteriota are unique because ancient evolutionary innovations, such as oxygenic photosynthesis, can be corroborated with fossil and biogeochemical records. At the same time, sequencing of extant natural populations allows the tracking of recombination events and gene flow over much shorter timescales. Here, we review the challenges of assessing the impact of gene flow across the whole range of evolutionary timescales. Understanding the tempo and constraints to gene flow in Cyanobacteriota can help decipher the timing of key functional innovations, analyze adaptation to local environments, and design Cyanobacteriota for robust use in biotechnology.",40929513
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Engineering and Functional Expression of the Type III Secretion System in <i>Xenorhabdus</i>: Enhancing Insecticidal Efficacy and Expanding T3SE Libraries.,"Entomopathogenic nematode symbiotic bacteria (EPNB) enhance nematode insecticidal capacity through symbiosis. This study cloned the complete 32-kb type III secretion system (T3SS) gene cluster from <i>Photorhabdus luminescens</i> TT01 using Red/ET recombineering and functionally expressed it in T3SS-deficient <i>Xenorhabdus stockiae</i> HN_xs01. Heterologous T3SS expression significantly enhanced HN_xs01 adhesion and invasion capabilities in CF-203 cells. In <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> models, the engineered strain induced severe intestinal damage by suppressing antimicrobial peptide expression and demonstrated improved colonization and biocontrol efficacy (LC<sub>50</sub> decreased by 3.7-fold). Crucially, the TT01 derived T3SS mediated delivery of XopAa novel effector exhibiting YopJ-family homology and characteristic T3SS effector featuresinto host cells. These findings establish the synthetic biology-driven potential of T3SS and its effectors for biological control applications while providing a mechanistic framework for future research.",40928961
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with Tuber spp. Enhances host performances in Pinus and Carya and induces host-specific patterns in defense-related regulation in the leaf transcriptomes.,"Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) colonize roots to establish symbiotic associations with plants. Sporocarps of the EMF Tuber spp. are considered as a delicacy in numerous countries and is a kind of EMF of great economic and social importance. Elucidating host responses to Tuber colonization would facilitate the exploration of symbiotic interactions and contribute to truffle cultivation. Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense, two primary commercial truffle species in China, were selected to colonize Pinus armandii and Carya illinoinensis in a two-and-a-half-year symbiosis experiment. Host performances, including growth, nutrient uptake, and physiological characteristics, were dynamically monitored. The molecular response of host leaf to Tuber symbiosis was further analyzed using RNA-seq.Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense exhibited superior colonization of P. armandii compared to that of C. illinoinensis. Both Tuber species enhanced the performance of the two hosts by increasing their height, stem circumference, and biomass. Phosphorus levels and activities of peroxidase and catalase in hosts were observed to increase during Tuber symbiosis. The results confirmed that Tuber colonization led to significant alterations in leaf transcriptomic profiles of the two trees. Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense both elicited defense-related regulation in host leaves, such as secondary metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction, with distinct patterns in P. armandii and C. illinoinensis. Our study provides an evaluation of host performance during truffle symbiosis and highlights the diverse patterns of Tuber-induced systematic defense regulation in hosts, offering insights into the specific symbiotic traits of Tuber-host pairs.",40928528
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Diversity and spread of cytoplasmic incompatibility genes among maternally inherited symbionts.,"Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) causes embryonic lethality in arthropods, resulting in a significant reduction in reproductive success. In most cases, this reproductive failure is driven by Wolbachia endosymbionts through their cifA-cifB gene pair, whose products disrupts arthropod DNA replication during embryogenesis. While a cif pair has been considered a hallmark of Wolbachia, its presence and functional significance in other bacterial lineages remains poorly investigated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 762 genomes spanning non-Wolbachia endosymbionts and their close relatives, revealing that the cif pair is far more widespread than previously recognized. We identified cif loci in 8.4% of the surveyed genomes, with a striking incidence of 17.4% in facultative symbionts. Beyond Wolbachia, cif pair occurs across eight bacterial genera spanning -Proteobacteria, -Proteobacteria, Mollicutes, and Bacteroidota. Notably, cif pair has been identified in several intracellular pathogens of mammals showing high rate of transovarial transmission in their arthropod hosts, suggesting a potential role of cif pair and CI in vector-borne disease dynamics. Structural analyses further reveal that the PD(D/E)-XK nucleases and AAA-ATPase-like motifs are consistently conserved across cif pairs in all bacterial taxa. Moreover, cif pairs are frequently integrated within diverse mobile genetic elements, from transposons to large intact WO prophages in Wolbachia and RAGEs in Rickettsiaceae. Phylogenetic analyses reveal recent and potentially ongoing horizontal transfers of cif pair between distantly related bacterial lineages, a process potentially facilitated by mobile genetic elements. Indeed, the PDDEXK2 transposase exhibits a phylogenetic pattern consistent with the co-transmission of cif genes, suggesting that it may facilitate horizontal transfers of cif across bacterial lineages. Furthermore, the detection of endosymbionts harboring cif pair in arthropod groups where Wolbachia is scarce, such as ticks, suggests that CI may be more widespread than previously known, with significant implications for arthropod symbiosis, reproductive manipulation, and future biocontrol strategies.",40924749
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Convergent evolution of <i>NFP</i>-facilitated root nodule symbiosis.,"The origin and phylogenetic distribution of symbiotic associations between nodulating angiosperms and nitrogen-fixing bacteria have long intrigued biologists. Recent comparative evolutionary analyses have yielded alternative hypotheses: a multistep pathway of independent gains and losses of root nodule symbiosis vs. a single gain followed by numerous losses. A detailed reconstruction of the history of genes involved in signaling between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and potential hosts, particularly lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signaling, is needed to distinguish between these hypotheses. LCO recognition by plants involves the Nod Factor Perception (<i>NFP</i>) gene family; in the legume model <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (Fabales), <i>MtNFP</i> is essential for establishing rhizobial symbiosis. Here, we document convergent evolution of <i>NFP</i>, indicating multiple origins of LCO-driven symbiosis. In contrast to previous models that explain the recruitment of <i>NFP</i> via a single duplication in the ancestor of the nitrogen-fixing clade, our phylogenomic and synteny results suggest this duplication does not span the entire clade. Tandem duplication in a common ancestor of Cucurbitales and Rosales resulted in the <i>NFP1</i> and <i>NFP2</i> groups. In contrast, the phylogenetically closest paralog of <i>MtNFP</i> is <i>MtLYR1</i>, located on a different chromosome within a large syntenic block. All available data indicate that a large-scale duplication resulted in <i>MtNFP</i> and <i>MtLYR1</i>, likely corresponding to a whole-genome duplication in an ancestor of subfamily Papilionoideae of Fabaceae. We show that <i>MtNFP</i> and the <i>NFP2</i>-like group are not orthologous, indicating multiple independent gains of <i>NFP</i>-based LCO signaling. This molecular convergence provides a possible mechanism for multiple gains of root nodule symbiosis across the nitrogen-fixing clade.",40924454
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Targeted Genome Editing of the ACC Deaminase Gene in Bradyrhizobium: Toward Enhanced Plant Growth and Stress Tolerance.,"Ensuring sufficient crop yields in an era of rapid population growth and limited arable land requires innovative strategies to enhance plant resilience and sustain, or even improve, growth and productivity despite environmental stress. Besides symbiotic nitrogen fixation, rhizobia may play a central role in sustainable agriculture by alleviating the detrimental effects of ethylene-a key stress hormone in plants-especially under conditions like drought through the deamination of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). In this study, we focused on genetically engineering a new Bradyrhizobium sp. isolate (Strain 9) from peanut root nodules to enhance its ACC deaminase activity. First, we developed a sacB-based genome-engineering tool and used it to knock out the ACC deaminase gene (acdS), confirming that its disruption severely diminished the strain's capacity to degrade ACC. Subsequently, we constructed an acdS-overexpressing strain by integrating a strong promoter and an optimized ribosome binding site upstream of acdS, achieving a five-fold increase in ACC deaminase activity relative to the wild-type. Peanut inoculation experiments demonstrated that both the acdS knockout and overexpression mutants effectively nodulated roots without impairing plant growth and nitrogen fixation, indicating that these modifications did not compromise symbiosis. Overall, this study highlights the utility of sacB-mediated counter-selection for precise genome editing in Bradyrhizobium and underscores the potential of enhanced ACC deaminase activity to improve plant growth under stress conditions. These findings pave the way for developing next-generation bioinoculants with superior ethylene mitigation capabilities, contributing to more productive and sustainable crop systems.",40922700
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Transcriptomics analysis for elucidating the mechanism underlying the enhancement of Arabidopsis Thaliana growth by the endophytic fungus Clonostachys rosea.,"Endophytic fungi are nonpathogenic fungi that live symbiotically in the interior of healthy plant tissues and form mutualistic associations with their hosts. These fungi are critically involved in promoting plant development, strengthening plant uptake of nutrients, and improving plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Endophytic fungi improve plant growth by synthesizing phytohormones (e.g., auxins and gibberellins), solubilizing phosphorus, and enabling nitrogen fixation, thereby enhancing nutrient availability and root development. Previously, we isolated an endophytic fungal strain named AE16 from Actinidia eriantha Benth., a traditional Chinese medicinal plant; this strain was found to substantially stimulate Arabidopsis thaliana growth. Here, to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted transcriptome sequencing analysis and used bioinformatics tools to determine the transcriptome profiles of AE16-inoculated A. thaliana root tissues. We obtained 683 genes with differential expressions, including 391 and 292 upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. We screened and validated 25 selected genes with a role in plant growth promotion (3 photosynthesis-related genes, 14 starch- and glucose metabolism-related genes, 6 plant hormone synthesis-related genes, and 2 cell transport-related genes). These genes, along with the ERF family of transcription factors, might have a crucial role in promoting A. thaliana growth. The strain AE16 was identified as Clonostachys rosea according to its morphological characteristics and ITS sequencing results. These results further clarify the mechanisms of the mutualistic association between A. thaliana and C. rosea and provide theoretical support to obtain sustained agricultural yield of other plants.",40920224
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",GacA regulates symbiosis and mediates lifestyle transitions in <i>Pseudomonas</i>.,"Through horizontal gene transfer, closely related bacterial strains assimilate distinct sets of genes, resulting in significantly varied lifestyles. However, it remains unclear how strains properly regulate horizontally transferred virulence genes. We hypothesized that strains may use components of the core genome to regulate diverse horizontally acquired genes. To investigate how closely related bacteria assimilate and activate horizontally acquired DNA, we used a model consisting of strains in the <i>brassicacearum</i>/<i>corrugata</i>/<i>mediterranea</i> (BCM) subclade <i>of Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> species N2E2 and N2C3, which exhibit contrasting lifestyles on the model plant <i>Arabidopsis. Pseudomonas</i> sp. N2E2 is a plant commensal and contains genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes for the antifungal compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). In contrast, <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. N2C3 lacks DAPG biosynthesis and has gained a pathogenic island encoding syringomycin (SYR)- and syringopeptin (SYP)-like toxins from the plant pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. This causes a transition in lifestyle from plant-protective N2E2 to plant-pathogenic N2C3. We found that N2E2 and N2C3 share a highly conserved two-component system GacA/S, a known regulator of DAPG and SYR/SYP. Using knockout mutations, we found that a <i>gacA</i> mutation resulted in loss of expression of SYR/SYP virulence genes and returned pathogenic N2C3 to a plant commensal lifestyle. Our study further explored the conservation of regulatory control across strains by demonstrating that GacA genes from both distant and closely related <i>Pseudomonas</i> strains could functionally complement one another across the genus.IMPORTANCEEmerging pathogens represent a significant threat to humans, agriculture, and natural ecosystems. Bacterial horizontal gene transfer (HGT) aids in the acquisition of novel genes that facilitate adaptation to new environments. Our work shows a novel role for GacA in orchestrating the regulatory changes necessary for virulence and lifestyle transitions facilitated by HGT. These findings suggest that the GacA/S system plays a key role in mediating transitions across diverse <i>Pseudomonas</i> symbiotic lifestyles. This work provides insights into the mechanisms that drive the emergence of pathogenic strains and highlights potential targets for managing bacterial threats to plant health.",40919919

Despite its economic importance, its trophic strategy and genomic adaptations remain elusive. Here, we presented high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies for two sexually compatible monokaryons (PP78 and PP85) of <i>P. portentosus</i>. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a genome size difference of 1.17 Mb (30.87 vs. 32.04 Mb), primarily attributed to transposable element (TE) expansion in strain PP85. Genome structural variations were largely driven by TEs, particularly LTR retrotransposons. DNA transposons were also involved in structural rearrangement of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, impacting their organization and transcriptional profiles. Functional annotation identified 187 PP78-specific and 236 PP85-specific genes, with the latter enriched in TE-related and putative virulence factors. <i>P. portentosus</i> displays genomic signatures of both ECM symbiosis (reduced lignocellulose-degrading enzymes) and saprotroph (expanded glycoside hydrolase 31 and sugar transporters), supporting a facultative ECM lifestyle. The expansion of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase pathways, alongside contraction of terpenoid clusters typical of ECM fungi, further indicated its adaptation to saprotroph. These findings highlight the role of TEs in driving genome plasticity, metabolic diversity, and nuclear divergence in <i>P. portentosus</i>, providing valuable genomic resources for this species.",40917997
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Heat Stress Drives Rapid Viral and Antiviral Innate Immunity Activation in Hexacorallia.,"The class Hexacorallia, encompassing stony corals and sea anemones, plays a critical role in marine ecosystems. Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. Here the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is used to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter genes showed significant upregulation. Further, transcriptomes from N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata were analysed to reveal stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected N. vectensis to heat stress and measured the transcription dynamics of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30min, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia.",40916562

The iron oxide facilitates the efficient transfer of electrons generated by MR-1 to microalgal photosystem via the pathway of CymA-MtrC-OmcA to -FeO. This process enhances the removals of TOC, TN, and NH-N in the MR-1 bacterial-algal consortium by 9.99%, 12.32%, and 52.25% respectively via OmcA regulation while boosting phosphorus removal by 16.27% through CymA regulation. The consortium exhibits 26.76% lower CO emission and 62.93% higher biomass productivity. When integrated into microbial fuel cells with cymA mutants, -FeO elevates open-circuit voltage by 283.33%, confirming its ability to compensate for electron deficiencies caused by CymA defects. -FeO enhances energy metabolisms (TCA cycle, quinone pool, and photosynthesis) to modulate the key metabolites including starch/sucrose, glycolysis, amino acids, lipids, and quorum sensing. These adaptations strengthen the symbiotic interactions and utilization of MR-1 bacterial-algal consortium for carbon and nutrients. Reactor experiments validate that -FeO integration with the consortium achieves 93.43% COD removal and 55.99% NH-N removal, while reducing NO emissions by 61.37%. The results reveal the interplay between OmcA, CymA, and iron oxides in optimizing bacterial-algal consortia and underscore the molecular mechanisms underlying iron oxide-enhanced EET for developing low-carbon, resource-efficient wastewater treatment.",40915132
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Editing a gibberellin receptor gene improves yield and nitrogen fixation in soybean.,"Soybean is an important source of oil, protein, and feed. However, its yield is far below that of major cereal crops. The green revolution increased the yield of cereal crops partially through high-density planting of lodging-resistant semi-dwarf varieties, but required more nitrogen fertilizers, posing an environmental threat. Genes that can improve nitrogen use efficiency need to be integrated into semi-dwarf varieties to avoid the overuse of fertilizers without the loss of dwarfism. Unlike cereal crops, soybean can assimilate atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Here, we created new alleles of GmGID1-2 (Glycine max GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1-2) using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) editing, which improved soybean architecture, yield, seed oil content, and nitrogen fixation, by regulation of important pathways and known genes related to branching, lipid metabolism, and nodule symbiosis. GmGID1-2 knockout reduced plant height, and increased stem diameter and strength, number of branches, nodes on the primary stem, pods, and seeds per plant, leading to an increase in seed weight per plant and yield in soybean. The nodule number, nodule weight, nitrogenase activity, and nitrogen content were also improved in GmGID1-2 knockout soybean lines, which is novel compared with the semi-dwarf genes in cereal crops. No loss-of-function allele for GmGID1-2 was identified in soybean germplasm and the edited GmGID1-2s are superior to the natural alleles, suggesting the GmGID1-2 knockout mutants generated in this study are valuable genetic resources to further improve soybean yield and seed oil content in future breeding programs. This study illustrates the pleiotropic functions of the GID1 knockout alleles with positive effects on plant architecture, yield, and nitrogen fixation in soybean, which provides a promising strategy toward sustainable agriculture.",40911442

However, inoculating soybeans with these rhizobia under field conditions often fails because of the competition from indigenous rhizobia that possess low or no N<sub>2</sub>OR activity. In this work, we utilize natural incompatibility systems between soybean and rhizobia to address this challenge. Specifically, Rj2 and GmNNL1 inhibit certain rhizobial infections in response to NopP, an effector protein. By combining a soybean line with a hybrid accumulation of the Rj2 and GmNNL1 genes and bradyrhizobia lacking the nopP gene, we develop a soybean-bradyrhizobial symbiosis system in which strains with high N<sub>2</sub>OR activity predominantly infect.

Clonal anemones were inoculated with xenic Breviolum minutum (SSB01) and microbiome manipulated cultures after antibacterial or antifungal treatment. The asexual reproduction of pedal laceration allowed for three generations of clonal aposymbiotic Aiptasia to be included in this study, from the initial adult generation (G0), to the first (G1) and second (G2) generation. We inoculated small and large G1 Aiptasia with algae and monitored onset of symbiosis, rate of algal proliferation, and holobiont characteristics. Sequencing the 16S and 18S rRNA gene regions identified significant differences in the bacterial and fungal communities of the G0 and G1 generations, alongside differences between the size classes of small and large G1 anemones. The microbiome of larger G1 individuals was distinct to the smaller G1 anemones, suggesting a microbiome maturation process. Control B. minutum cultures exhibited a significantly greater proliferation rate in large G1 anemones when compared to antibacterial or antifungal treated cultures, whereas the opposite trend was documented in the small G1 anemones. Although no differences were observed between algal photochemical parameters, or the growth and behavior of G1 juveniles, we observed a significant influence in the production of G2 clones between treatments.

A unique feature of the diatom-Richelia symbioses is the symbiont cellular location spans a continuum of integration (epibiont, periplasmic, and endobiont) that is reflected in the symbiont genome size and content. In this study, we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes of Richelia symbionts, focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short-length transposases and pseudogenes in the periplasmic symbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. By contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer transposases and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and retain most genes in the core genome, whereas periplasmic symbionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, indicating higher genomic plasticity compared with the genomes of endobionts. Functional gene comparisons with other N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by the absence of specific pathways (e.g., cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase and lipid A) that increase both dependency and direct interactions with their respective hosts.

At the same time, the global population is projected to exceed 9 billion by 2050, demanding a 70% increase in food production (UN, 2019; FAO). Agriculture, responsible for 34% of global greenhouse gas emissions, urgently needs sustainable solutions. Microbial inoculants, known as ""plant probiotics,"" offer a promising eco-friendly alternative by enhancing crop resilience and reducing environmental impact. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits and melatonin-producing capacity of <i>Bacillus aerius</i> EH2-5. To assess its efficacy under salt stress, soybean seedlings at the VC stage were inoculated with EH2-5 and subsequently subjected to salinity stress using 150 mM and 100 mM NaCl treatments. Plant growth parameters, the expression levels of salinity-related genes, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were measured to determine the microbe's role in promoting plant growth and mitigating salt-induced oxidative stress. Here, our study shows that the melatonin-synthesizing <i>Bacillus aerius</i> EH2-5 (7.48ng/mL at 24 h after inoculation in Trp spiked LB media) significantly improved host plant (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) growth, biomass, and photosynthesis and reduced oxidative stress during salinity stress conditions than the non-inculcated control. Whole genome sequencing of <i>Bacillus aerius</i> EH2-5 identified key plant growth-promoting and salinity stress-related genes, including znuA, znuB, znuC, and zur (zinc uptake); ptsN, aspA, and nrgB (nitrogen metabolism); and phoH and pstS (phosphate transport). Genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis and transport, such as trpA, trpB, trpP, and tspO, along with siderophore-related genes yusV, yfhA, and yfiY, were also detected. The presence of multiple stress-responsive genes, including dnaK, dps, treA, cspB, srkA, and copZ, suggests EH2-5's genomic potential to enhance plant tolerance to salinity and other abiotic stresses. Inoculation with <i>Bacillus aerius</i> EH2-5 significantly enhanced soybean growth and reduced salt-induced damage, as evidenced by increased shoot biomass (29%, 41%), leaf numbers (12% and 13%), and chlorophyll content (40%, 21%) under 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl compared to non-inoculated plants. These results indicate EH2-5's strong potential as a plant growth-promoting and salinity stress-alleviating rhizobacterium. The EH2-5 symbiosis significantly enhanced a key ABA biosynthesis enzyme-related gene NCED3, dehydration responsive transcription factors DREB2A and NAC29 salinity stresses (100 mM and 150 mM). Moreover, the reduced expression of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) by 16%, 29%, and 24%, respectively, and decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydroxy peroxidase (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by 12% and 23% were observed under 100 mM NaCl compared to non-inoculated plants. This study demonstrated that <i>Bacillus aerius</i> EH2-5, a melatonin-producing strain, not only functions effectively as a biofertilizer but also alleviates plant stress in a manner comparable to the application of exogenous melatonin. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing melatonin-producing microbes as a viable alternative to chemical treatments. Therefore, further research should focus on enhancing the melatonin biosynthetic capacity of EH2-5, improving its colonization efficiency in plants, and developing synergistic microbial consortia (SynComs) with melatonin-producing capabilities. Such efforts will contribute to the development and field application of EH2-5 as a promising plant biostimulant for sustainable agriculture.",40869153

Among these microbiota-responsive genes, a conserved gene cluster of four PLCPs (OsCP14, OsCP16, OsCP19, and OsCP25) exhibited root-specific and microbiota-inducible expression. Reporter lines of OsCP25 promoter-driven green fluorescence protein (GFP) and -glucuronidase (GUS) confirmed its microbiota-inducible expression in the root epidermis and pericycle cells. The oscp14/oscp19 (double mutant), oscp16, and oscp25 knockout mutants presented reduced root cysteine protease activity by 27%, 52%, and 37%, respectively, but this did not affect pathogen resistance or plant growth. Strikingly, compared with those of the wild type, the culturable bacterial loads of the oscp14/oscp19, oscp16, and oscp25 mutants were reduced by approximately 2-fold. Conversely, the overexpression of both OsCP14 and OsCP25 consistently increased bacterial colonization. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that 17 bacterial taxa were depleted in oscp mutant roots.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","JA Signaling Inhibitor JAZ Is Involved in Regulation of AM Symbiosis with Cassava, Including Symbiosis Establishment and Cassava Growth.","Mutualism between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is imperative for sustainable agricultural production. Jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction has been demonstrated to play an important role in AMF symbiosis with the host. In this study, SC9 cassava was selected as the research object to investigate the effect of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway on symbiosis establishment and cassava growth in AMF and cassava symbiosis. It was first found that the symbiosis of cassava and mycorrhizal fungi could increase the biomass of both the aboveground and belowground parts of cassava. Secondly, JA content increased significantly in the early stage of AMF inoculation and auxin content increased significantly in the late stage of AMF inoculation, suggesting that JA signal transduction played an important role in the symbiosis between cassava and mycorrhizal fungi. Transcriptome data were used to analyze the expression differences of genes related to JA synthesis and signal transduction in cassava. The <i>MeJAZ</i> gene positively responded to symbiosis between cassava and mycorrhizal fungi. The analysis of MeJAZ gene family expression and its promoter supported this result. Spraying different concentrations of MeJA on leaves could affect the colonization rate and root biomass of cassava, indicating that JA was an active regulator of mycorrhizal formation. PPI prediction and qPCR analysis suggested that the <i>MeJAZ7</i> gene might be a key transcriptional regulator responding to jasmonic acid signals and regulating mycorrhizal influence on cassava growth and development.",40863553

In this study, we examine the draft genome of Xenorhabdus bovienii strain MEL2.2, which was isolated from entomopathogenic nematodes in Melbourne, Australia. The genome of Xenorhabdus strain MEL2.2 spans approximately 4.4 million base pairs and has a G+C content of 44.8%, aligning with known characteristics of the genus. Within the genome, 3,823 protein-coding genes were identified. Functional analysis revealed genes associated with nematode symbiosis and insect virulence. Moreover, 15 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were detected, potentially responsible for synthesizing various secondary metabolites. Comparative genomic analysis indicated a combination of conserved and strain-specific genes when compared to other Xenorhabdus bovieniistrains, suggesting genetic traits that may enhance MEL2.2's adaptability and pathogenicity.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Rickettsia symbionts favor whitefly ovary development by promoting germ cell mitosis.,"Maternally inherited symbionts can impact the reproduction of their host insects in various ways. The ovary is critical for the successful reproduction of female insects. Such symbionts have strong ovary tropism. Intracellular symbionts depend on host cells for replication and transmission. However, the cellular mechanisms by which symbionts impact insect reproduction through affecting ovary development have seldom been investigated. Our previous work has shown that the facultative symbiont Rickettsia can be vertically transmitted through eggs in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and Rickettsia increases female fecundity. This study is aimed to explore the cellular mechanisms of Rickettsia symbionts affecting the whitefly fecundity. We found that Rickettsia symbionts are highly concentrated in the tropharium of whitefly ovarioles. We demonstrated that Rickettsia increases whitefly fecundity by promoting ovary development. Moreover, Rickettsia enhances the expression of cell division genes (Cyclin B1 and CDK1) and germ cell mitosis. Furthermore, Cyclin B1 and CDK1 gene silencing or CDK1 inhibitor treatment reduced the germ cell mitosis, delayed ovary development and decreased whitefly fecundity. Overall, we revealed that Rickettsia promotes ovary development by regulating germ cell mitosis, which enhances whitefly fecundity. These findings suggest that regulating the host cell cycle by the symbiont is important for the maintenance of the intracellular symbiosis. This study provides new insights into the cellular mechanism of symbionts regulating host reproduction.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Coordinated regulation of pH alkalinization by two transcription factors promotes fungal commensalism and pathogenicity.,"As a clinically relevant opportunistic human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans is able to rapidly sense and adapt to changing microenvironments within the host, a process that is essential for its successful invasion and survival. Although studies have shown that the transcription factor Stp2 is the master regulator of environmental alkalinization, accumulating evidence supports a clear involvement of other participants in this adaptation process. Here, following a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor Dal81 as an uncharacterized positive regulator of pH alkalinization in C. albicans. Dal81 influences the protein levels of Stp2. A mutant lacking DAL81 also fails to alkalinize both in vitro and in the phagolysosome, and this defective phenotype is further enhanced by deleting both factors in most cases. Notably, our results demonstrate that Dal81 physically interacts with Stp2 to co-regulate the expression of a broad set of downstream target genes related to metabolism of organic acids, oxoacids, carboxylic acids and amino acids. This coordinated regulation mode is required for the alkalinization process and plays a role in modulating commensalism and pathogenicity of C. albicans. Taken together, our findings elucidate the cooperative function of Dal81 with Stp2 in the nucleus to orchestrate the expression of downstream genes required for the survival and propagation of C. albicans in the host.",40846842

It lives obligatorily on gorgonian corals, mimicking their polyps with pink coloration and skin protuberances. Unique for seahorses, pygmy seahorses retain juvenile paedomorphic stunted snouts, resembling the coral's polyps. We analyzed the tiny seahorse's genome revealing the genomic bases of several adaptations to their mutualistic life including substantial reductions in conserved noncoding elements that are associated with genes in the vicinity of those CNEs that are known to play a role in growth and metamorphosis-related pathways. Comparative RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses during their ontogeny suggest that their stunted snout might result from craniofacial remodeling associated with <i>hoxa2b</i> defunctionalization. This is consistent also with findings from in situ hybridization and CRISPR experiments. Their immune system shows extremely low numbers of MHC genes and additional considerable losses of other immune-related genes.

However, the understanding of pathogens infecting non-model insect species in natural ecosystems, or their interactions with other insect-associated microorganisms, is fragmentary. Here, we tested a conceptually novel approach - the simultaneous sequencing of insect, fungal, and bacterial marker gene amplicons - as a means of dissecting interactions among entomopathogenic fungi in the genus Entomophthora and their dipteran hosts in South Greenland. We aimed to describe the taxonomic diversity of Entomophthora, their dipteran hosts, and the bacterial diversity within a set of field-collected dead insects exhibiting signs of Entomophthora infection. Across nine collected dipteran species, we identified multiple Entomophthora genotypes, with strong but not perfect patterns of host-specificity across the five targeted marker regions. Additionally, we found consistent differences in bacterial community composition among fungus-killed fly species and sampling sites. Our results substantially expand the knowledge of Entomopthora diversity and host associations while providing the very first insights into associated bacteria and their potential roles.

Here, Acropora gemmifera, a common Indo-Pacific coral cultured in in situ seawater from Luhuitou reef at three levels of pCO<sub>2</sub> (pH 8.14, 7.83, 7.54), showed significantly delayed larval metamorphosis and juvenile growth, but adapted to long-term high pCO<sub>2</sub>. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) emerged as a time- and dose-dependent mode of short-term response (3days post settlement, d p.s.) and long-term acclimation (40 d p.s.), with more DEGs responding to high pCO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.54) than to medium pCO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.83).

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",The sTDIF signaling peptide modulates the root stele diameter and primary metabolism to accommodate symbiotic nodulation.,"Legume plants form specific organs on their root system, the nitrogen-fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic interaction with soil bacteria collectively named rhizobia. Rhizobia, however, do not only induce the formation of these nodule organs but also modulate root system architecture. We identified in Medicago truncatula a previously unnoticed increase in the root stele diameter occurring upon rhizobium inoculation. This symbiotic root response, similarly observed in another crop legume, pea, occurs rapidly and locally after rhizobium inoculation, leading to an increased number of vascular cells. Interestingly, this root stele diameter symbiotic response requires tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor (TDIF) signaling peptides and, notably, the MtCLE37 TDIF-encoding gene whose expression is increased during nodulation, thus being referred to as symbiotic nodulation TDIF (sTDIF). Indeed, a cle37/stdif mutant is not responsive to rhizobium regarding its root stele diameter increase and has a reduced nodule number. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that stdif has a defective primary metabolism, notably affecting carbohydrate/sugar accumulation in both roots and nodules. Remarkably, a sucrose or a malate exogenous treatment is able to rescue the rhizobium-induced stele diameter symbiotic response in stdif. This metabolic deregulation is thus instrumental in explaining the altered symbiotic response of the mutant. Overall, this study highlights a novel function of TDIF signaling peptides in legumes plants, which, beyond regulating stele development, also modulates the root primary metabolism adaptations required for symbiotic nodule development.",40834857

This study investigates how macrolactin A (McA)-a polyketide antibiotic produced by plant-beneficial Bacillus velezensis-shapes soil microbial communities and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles under various agricultural scenarios. Using high-throughput metagenomics and network analysis, we compared untreated soils with those exposed to two McA concentrations: a high dose (10mg/kg soil, representing potential point-source accumulation) and a low dose (1mg/kg, mimicking natural rhizosphere levels). While overall ARG - and -diversity remained stable, we observed significant taxonomic restructuring, with Pseudomonadota increasing by 1.36-2.15% and Actinomycetota declining by 1.14-1.74% across treatments. Resistome analysis showed dose-dependent ARG selection: control soils favored target alteration mechanism, whereas McA promoted efflux, inactivation, and protection mechanisms. Network analysis demonstrated disruption of complex ARG-host associations, as control-dominant genera belonging to Actinomycetota (Conexibacter, Baekduia, and Capillimicrobium) maintaining 16-21 ARGs per genome decreased, while genera belonging to Pseudomonadota (Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Paraburkholderia, and Piscinibacter) with streamlined resistomes (1-2 ARGs) became prevalent. Functional gene profiling (COGs) and annotation of MAGs revealed dose-dependent restructuring: low-dose McA enriched chemotaxis systems and broad-spectrum efflux pumps, facilitating motile escape and energy-efficient resistance, whereas high-dose exposure selected for secondary metabolite synthesis, metal transporters, and cell wall remodeling genes, indicating defensive countermeasures. These findings demonstrate McA's biphasic selection: low doses favor avoidance strategies (efflux/motility), while high doses enforce biosynthetic defenses and structural resilience. The results support the hypothesis that narrow-spectrum antibiotics act as ecosystem engineers through metabolic trade-offs, highlighting the need to evaluate resistome restructuring in biocontrol agent risk assessments.",40834509

Rhizobia have a different lipid A structure from other Gram-negative bacteria. The 3-hydroxy group on the 2' or 3' myristate acyl chain of its lipid A is substituted by a unique very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA). VLCFAs are transferred to lipid A by an acyltransferase MsbB. In this research, we constructed the <i>msbB</i> deletion mutant, complementary, and overexpression strains of <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103, and investigated their free-living and symbiotic phenotypes. The findings revealed that deletion of <i>msbB</i> had no impact on the autonomous growth of HH103, yet significantly reduced the resistance of rhizobia to abiotic stresses. The promoter-GUS assays revealed that <i>msbB</i> was mainly expressed at the early stage of nodulation. Quantitative analysis of early infection revealed that the mutation of <i>msbB</i> significantly reduced root hair curling, infection threads, and nodule primordia, suggesting impairment of the symbiotic infection process. The nodulation assay and transmission electron microscopy analysis of nodule ultrastructure showed that <i>msbB</i> deletion led to the formation of ineffective root nodules without colonization of rhizobia, thereby causing a loss of nitrogen fixation capacity. RNA-seq analysis indicated that HH103<i>msbB</i> inoculation trigger a localized defense response in the soybean root to result in symbiotic deficiencies. Taken together, these results reveal the important role of VLCFAs in soybean rhizobia in the establishment of effective symbiosis and nodule nitrogen fixation.",40833026

We analyzed the transcriptome of M. paradoxa and the genomes of the ectosymbiotic spirochete Propulsinema mixotrichae (""Treponematales""), the rod-shaped ectosymbiont Synergitannerella mixotrichae (Bacteroidales), and the endosymbiont Endomicrobiellum mixotrichae (Endomicrobiales), all of which are obligately associated with M. paradoxa and were taxonomically described in this study. Mixotricha paradoxa highly expressed genes for diverse glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and likely ferments sugars to H2, CO2, acetate, ethanol, and glycerol. Similar to the case for parasitic parabasalids such as Trichomonas vaginalis, transcripts for biosynthesis of nucleotides and many amino acids were not detected in our analyses of M. paradoxa. Propulsinema mixotrichae possesses genes encoding proteins for the assembly of flagella and for those in pathways associated with chemotaxis and dinitrogen fixation. Such genes are absent in S. mixotrichae, which instead possesses numerous genes encoding glycoside hydrolase enzymes, which are largely complementary to the glycoside hydrolase repertoire of M. paradoxa. Endomicrobiellum mixotrichae appears to provide nucleotides and nine amino acids to its host, which in turn likely supplies three amino acids, including tryptophan, to E. mixotrichae.

Plant fitness, therefore, relies on signaling pathways that mount an effective immune response against pathogens while fostering mutualistic symbioses. Plant pathways, and specifically immune genes that may act as ""switches,"" discriminating between pathogenic or mutualistic fungi, remain largely unknown. Using Eucalyptus grandis as a model system, we investigate alterations to the root transcriptomic landscape during pre-symbiosis with either the pathogen Armillaria luteobubalina or the mutualistic fungus Pisolithus microcarpus. Comparative analyses identified three strongly counter-regulated genes that may act as immune switches to accommodate or to repress fungal colonization. We characterized two of these, a MYB-like and RAN-like zinc finger protein, using a transgenic approach and demonstrated that they have bifunctional roles in the regulation of cell death and a hypersensitive-like response, depending on the lifestyle of the associated fungus. Using co-expression network analysis, we identified hypothetical pathways correlated to these genes. We functionally validated these predictions using plants with transgenic roots with increased or decreased transcription of these genes, thereby showing the power of co-expression networks as an a priori approach to identify key immune response pathways in plants.

Hna was first discovered in the nitrogen-fixing alphaproteobacterium <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i>, which forms root nodules on leguminous plants. We report that the efficacy of the Hna system depends on NolR, a transcriptional regulator known to regulate expression of nodulation genes. Strains carrying a mutant <i>nolR</i> gene (e.g., the widely used laboratory strain Rm1021) display dramatically reduced Hna-mediated phage resistance compared to those with the wild-type <i>nolR</i> gene. <i>hna</i> expression is approximately doubled in <i>nolR<sup>+</sup></i> (wild-type) compared to <i>nolR<sup>-</sup></i> strains. Integration of a second copy of <i>hna</i> increased phage resistance in a <i>nolR<sup>-</sup></i> strain >1,000-fold, indicating that a moderate <i>hna</i> expression difference is sufficient to affect the Hna phage resistance phenotype. NolR does not appear to directly regulate <i>hna</i>,as there is no predicted NolR binding site upstream of <i>hna</i>, and purified NolR protein does not bind to the <i>hna</i> upstream sequence. Other genes whose transcription is regulated by NolR were identified through RNA-seq experiments. These include the lipopolysaccharide sulfotransferase gene <i>lpsS</i>, which is located downstream of a NolR binding site. This work illustrates how modest differences in expression between strains can dramatically alter the protective phenotype of a defense system.IMPORTANCEThe ability of a bacterial culture to survive phage infection is significant in both medical (phage therapy) and industrial (e.g., cheese production) contexts. This study describes a factor that influences the efficacy of a recently discovered phage defense system (Hna) in the agriculturally relevant soil bacterium <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i>.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","Structure, evolution, and roles of MYB transcription factors proteins in secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways and abiotic stresses responses in plants: a comprehensive review.","Unlike mobile organisms, plants are sessile and thus more vulnerable to environmental stressors. Among these, abiotic stress represents a major constraint that profoundly affects plant growth and development. To cope with these challenges, plants have evolved sophisticated adaptive mechanisms to enhance their stress resilience. Transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in these adaptive processes, as they are activated by diverse stress signals and subsequently modulate the expression of stress-responsive genes, thereby improving plant survival under adverse conditions. The MYB TF family, one of the largest TF families in plants, participates in regulating various biological processes, including growth and development, phytohormone signaling, secondary metabolism and abiotic stress responses. Numerous studies have demonstrated that MYB TFs, upon activation by environmental stimuli, can bind to cis-acting elements in the promoters of downstream stress-responsive genes or interact with other proteins to fine-tune their expression, ultimately enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stress. Additionally, MYB TFs are integral components of phytohormone signaling pathways involved in stress adaptation. Although extensive research has been conducted on plant stress responses, the interplay between MYB TFs and phytohormones in mediating abiotic stress tolerance remains underexplored. In this review, we examine the structural features, classification, and functional mechanisms of MYB transcription factors. Furthermore, we summarize current knowledge on the roles of MYB TFs (both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent) in plant responses to various abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and heavy metal toxicity. We also discuss their regulatory roles in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates, flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans, and astragalosides. In conclusion, this review consolidates existing findings and provides a foundation for uncovering novel functions and regulatory mechanisms of the MYB TF family. Future research should prioritize MYB TFs as central regulators of abiotic stress-responsive gene networks, with the potential to improve crop stress tolerance and yield, thereby addressing global food security challenges.",40822724

Our results demonstrate that each sponge species harbors distinct and highly structured microbial communities. Proteobacteria, and especially Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, were generally dominant; however, unique dominance patterns,such as the near-exclusive presence of an uncharacterized Gammaproteobacterial lineage in Cliona celata,suggest strong host-symbiont specificity and possible coevolution.

In several Halichondria species, we detected the presence ofEntotheonella, a symbiont with high biosynthetic gene cluster diversity that may contribute to host chemical defense and metabolic versatility. Depth-driven differences in microbial community composition were exemplified byGeodia reniformis, whose microbiome was dominated by deep-sea adapted and metabolically versatile lineages such as SAR202, PAUC34f, and Dadabacteriales.

However, nitrogen fixation is transient, peaking several weeks after <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> colonization and declining as nodules senesce in coordination with host development. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms governing SNF and senescence, we conducted a temporal transcriptomic analysis of soybean nodules colonized with <i>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</i> USDA110. Weekly nodule samples (2-10 weeks post-inoculation, wpi) were analyzed using RNA and small RNA sequencing, while acetylene reduction assays assessed nitrogenase activity from 4 to 7 wpi. We identified three major nodule developmental phases: early development (2-3 wpi), nitrogen fixation (3-8 wpi), and senescence (8-10 wpi). Soybean showed extensive transcriptional reprogramming during senescence, whereas <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> underwent major transcriptional shifts early in development before stabilizing during nitrogen fixation. We identified seven soybean genes and several microRNAs as candidate biomarkers of nitrogen fixation, including <i>lipoxygenases</i> (<i>Lox</i>), suggesting roles for oxylipin metabolism. Soy <i>hemoglobin-2</i> (<i>Hb2</i>), previously classified as non-symbiotic, was upregulated during senescence, implicating oxidative stress responses within aging nodules. Upregulation of the <i>Bradyrhizobium paa</i> operon and <i>rpoH</i> during senescence suggested metabolic adaptation for survival beyond symbiosis. Additionally, <i>Bradyrhizobium NIF</i> gene expression showed stage-specific regulation, with <i>nifK</i> peaking at 2 wpi, <i>nifD</i> and <i>nifA</i> at 2 and 10 wpi, and <i>nifH</i>, <i>nifW</i>, and <i>nifS</i> at 10 wpi.

As a result, the pseudoflowers consist solely of tepal-like leaflets and a specialized chamber, and the larvae influence pigment biosynthesis. Hijacking plants developmental gene networks by insects to sequentially mediate dedifferentiation, cytokinin regulation, and tepal-like leaflets formation provides a framework to study highly elaborate forms of parasitism and symbiosis between plants and insects.",40810459
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","Spiroplasma, Wolbachia, Sodalis and trypanosome associations in Glossina Tachinoides from Yankari game reserve, Nigeria.","Tsetse flies are vectors of African trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects both humans and animals. Trypanosomiasis remains a threat to lives and it is an impediment to socio-economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. In spite of decades of chemotherapy and vector control, the disease has not been eradicated. Parasitic drug resistance has been developed to existing drugs, while vector control strategies are expensive and unsustainable. Therefore, there is a need to explore other control approaches, such as the transformation of tsetse fly endosymbionts to render the fly refractory to trypanosome infection. This research focused on investigating the prevalence and triparty association of infection of trypanosomes with some endosymbionts of tsetse flies from Yankari Game Reserve. Tsetse flies were captured using biconical traps, identified morphologically, dissected and their entire guts were isolated and used for DNA extraction. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used in confirming the identity of the tsetse flies by amplifying the cytochrome C oxidase-1 gene. PCR was also used to screen for the presence of endosymbionts (Sodalis glossinidius, Wolbachia, and Spiroplasma sp.) and trypanosomes. Glossina tachinoides was the only vector species identified. Trypanosome infection rate was 10.70% with Trypanosoma grayi being the most prevalent (9.78%) amongst the three trypanosome species detected. The prevalence of Wolbachia and Spiroplasma species were 2.80% and 40.8% respectively in flies. Sodalis glossinidius was not detected. There was an association between the presence of trypanosomes and Wolbachia, while no association was depicted between trypanosomes and Spiroplasma. It has been observed from this study that the presence of Wolbachia seems to favour trypanosome infections. Investigation on the Wolbachia genetic polymorphism in tsetse could help to better understand this association.",40804622

This conservation approach remains limited by our understanding of cellular mechanisms of resilience and trade-offs. Here, we demonstrate that downregulation of pa-BAK stabilizes the coral-algal endosymbiosis and slows bleaching during acute heat stress in Pocillopora acuta through coordinated expression of gene clusters. The improvement in thermal tolerance was closely related to the downregulation efficiency in individual corals. Oxidative DNA damage, a hallmark of thermal stress response, was prevented in corals with stabilized symbiosis, likely through a decrease in mitochondrial ROS release. We hypothesize that this manipulation causes a cascading molecular response, which may impact other traits such as oxidative mitochondrial damage, proving detrimental over the longer term. Developing our understanding of heat-stress defense mechanisms that promote stability in the coral-algal symbiosis is fundamental for effective modern coral reef restoration practices based on improving ecosystem resilience.",40804160

Corals are susceptible to extreme high-temperature stress in summer and extreme low-temperature stress in winter in the relatively high-latitude reef areas of the South China Sea (SCS). The most abundant symbiotic coral Symbiodiniaceae in the higher-latitude reefs of the SCS is Cladocopium goreaui, predominantly associating with dominant coral hosts such as Acropora and Porites. However, to date, relatively few studies have focused on the response and mechanism of C. goreaui to the extreme high- and low-temperature stress. In this study, the responses and regulatory mechanisms of the dominant C. goreaui to extreme high- and low-temperature stress were investigated based on physiological indexes, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transcriptome analysis. The results showed that (1) under 34 C heat stress, the disintegration of thylakoids triggered photosynthetic collapse in C. goreaui; survival is enabled through metabolic reprogramming that upregulates five protective pathways and redirects energy via pentose/glucuronate shunting to sustain ATP homeostasis, revealing a trade-off between damage containment and precision energy governance under thermal extremes. (2) Lowtemperature exposure induced suppression of maximum quantum yield (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>), compounded by glutathione pathway inhibition, crippling ROS scavenging.The transcriptome results revealed that C. goreaui prioritizes gene fidelity maintenance under low temperature stress. These findings reveal that energy allocation trade-offs constitute the core strategy of C. goreaui temperature response: prioritizing energy maintenance under high-temperature stress, while safeguarding genetic fidelity at the expense of antioxidant defense under low-temperature stress.",40797046

An innovative framework for studying diverse wild insect microbiota.,"Symbiotic microorganisms can profoundly impact insect biology, including their life history traits, population dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories. However, microbiota remain poorly understood in natural insect communities, especially in 'dark taxa'-hyperdiverse yet understudied clades. Here, we implemented a novel multi-target amplicon sequencing approach to study microbiota in complex, species-rich communities. It combines four methodological innovations: (1) To establish a host taxonomic framework, we sequenced amplicons of the host marker gene (COI) and reconstructed barcodes alongside microbiota characterisation using 16S-V4 rRNA bacterial gene amplicons. (2) To assess microbiota abundance, we incorporated spike-in-based quantification. (3) To improve the phylogenetic resolution for the dominant endosymbiont, Wolbachia, we analysed bycatch data from the COI amplicon sequencing. (4) To investigate the primary drivers of host-microbe associations in massive multi-dimensional datasets, we performed Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC). Applying this approach to 1842 wild-caught scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) from northern Sweden, we organised them into 480 genotypes and 186 species and gained unprecedented insights into their microbiota. We found orders-of-magnitude differences in bacterial abundance and massive within-population variation in microbiota composition. Patterns and drivers differed among microbial functional categories: the distribution and abundance of facultative endosymbionts (Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma) were shaped by host species, genotype, and sex. In contrast, many other bacterial taxa were broadly distributed across species and sites. This study highlights facultative endosymbionts as key players in insect microbiota and reveals striking variations in distributional patterns of microbial clades. It also demonstrates the power of integrative sequencing approaches in uncovering the ecological complexity and significance of symbiotic microorganisms in multi-species natural communities.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","Recombination, Truncation and Horizontal Transfer Shape the Diversity of Wolbachia-induced Cytoplasmic Incompatibility Patterns.","Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria inducing various reproductive manipulations of which cytoplasmic incompatibility is the most common. Cytoplasmic incompatibility leads to reduced embryo viability in crosses between males carrying Wolbachia and uninfected females or those carrying an incompatible symbiont strain. In the mosquito Culex pipiens, the Wolbachia wPip causes highly complex crossing patterns. This complexity is linked to the amplification and diversification of the cytoplasmic incompatibility causal genes, cidA and cidB, with polymorphism located in the CidA-CidB interaction regions. We previously showed that some compatibility patterns correlated with the presence or absence of specific cid variants. It is still unknown, however, whether cid gene polymorphism alone is sufficient to explain the diversity of crossing patterns observed in Cx. pipiens. Taking advantage of a new method enabling full-gene acquisition, we sequenced complete cid repertoires from 45 wPip strains collected worldwide. We demonstrated that the extensive diversity of cid genes arises from recombination and horizontal transfers. We uncovered further cidB polymorphism located outside the interface regions and strongly correlated with cytoplasmic incompatibility patterns. Most importantly, we showed that in every wPip genome, all but one cidB variant are truncated. Truncated cidBs located in palindromes are partially or completely deprived of their deubiquitinase domain, crucial for cytoplasmic incompatibility. The identity of the sole full-length cidB variant seems to dictate cytoplasmic incompatibility patterns, irrespective of the truncated cidBs present. Truncated CidBs exhibit reduced toxicity and stability in Drosophila cells, which potentially hinders their loading into sperm, essential for cytoplasmic incompatibility induction.",40796352
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Selection Maintains Photosynthesis in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium Despite Redundancy With its Fern Host.,"Vertically inherited symbionts experience different physical, chemical, and population genetic environments than free-living organisms. As a result, they can experience long-term reductions in effective population size (Ne) and weaker purifying selection on genes that are less important in the host-associated environment. Over time, these forces result in gene loss. A comparative genomic approach using independently evolved symbiotic bacteria and free-living relatives can reveal which genes are important in the symbiotic state. We apply this approach to understand why some diazotrophic cyanobacteria evolving as vertically inherited symbionts of photosynthetic eukaryotic hosts have lost their ancestral capacity for photosynthesis while others have retained that capacity. We look specifically at Trichormus azollae, a diazotrophic cyanobacterium that remains photosynthetic after 50 to 90 Ma as a vertically inherited symbiont of Azolla ferns. We show that gene loss is ongoing, with different genes lost across the eight T. azollae strains examined. We apply molecular evolutionary models to genomes of T. azollae and free-living relatives, finding genome-wide signatures of drift in T. azollae consistent with long-term reductions in Ne. Ribosomal proteins and proteins from the energy-capturing photosynthetic light reactions are under stronger purifying selection than genes from other pathways, including nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic carbon fixation. Strong purifying selection is expected for the ribosome given its extraordinary levels of conservation, even in ancient vertically inherited symbionts. That genes in the light reactions are under strong purifying selection and never lost in any strain suggests that energy capture, likely required for energy-intensive nitrogen fixation, remains important to this symbiont.",40795033

However, newer endosymbiotic models have challenged the origin and timing of such genetic integration during organellogenesis. <i>Epithemia</i> diatoms contain diazoplasts, obligate endosymbionts derived from cyanobacteria that are closely phylogenetically related to UCYN-A, a recently described nitrogen-fixing organelle. Diazoplasts function as permanent membrane compartments in <i>Epithemia</i> hosts, but it is unknown if genetic integration has occurred. We report genomic analyses of two <i>Epithemia</i> diatom species, freshwater <i>Epithemia clementina</i> and marine <i>E. pelagica</i>, which are highly divergent but share a common ancestor at the origin of the endosymbiosis <35Mya. We find minimal evidence for genetic integration. Segments of fragmented and rearranged DNA from the diazoplast were detected integrated into the <i>E. clementina</i> nuclear genome, but the transfers that have occurred so far are nonfunctional. No DNA or gene transfers were detected in <i>E. pelagica.</i> In <i>E. clementina</i>, 6 host-encoded proteins of unknown function were identified in the diazoplast proteome, far fewer than detected in recently acquired endosymbiotic organelles. Overall, <i>Epithemia</i> diazoplasts are a valuable counterpoint to existing organelle models, demonstrating that endosymbionts can function as integral compartments-maintained over millions of years of host speciation-absent significant genetic integration.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Central metabolism and development are rewired in lichenized cyanobacteria.,"Nostoc cyanobacteria are among the few organisms capable of fixing both carbon and nitrogen. These metabolic features are essential for the cyanolichen symbiosis, where Nostoc supplies both carbon (as glucose) and nitrogen (as ammonium) to a cyanolichen-forming fungal partner. This nutrient flow was established by seminal biochemical studies published in the 20th century. Since then, cyanolichen metabolism has received little attention, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the physiology of lichenized Nostoc remain mostly unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the genomic and transcriptional changes that enable Nostoc's metabolic role in cyanolichens. We used comparative genomics across 243 genomes of Nostoc s. lat. coupled with metatranscriptomic experiments using Peltigera cyanolichens. We found that genes for photoautotrophic carbon fixation are upregulated in lichenized Nostoc. This likely results in a higher rate of carbon fixation that allows Nostoc to provide carbon to the fungal partner while meeting its own metabolic needs. We also found that the transfer of ammonium from Nostoc to the lichen-forming fungus is facilitated by two molecular mechanisms: (i) transcriptional downregulation of glutamine synthetase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonium assimilation in Nostoc; and (ii) frequent losses of a putative high-affinity ammonium permease, which likely reduces Nostoc's capacity to recapture leaked ammonium. Finally, we found that the development of motile hormogonia is downregulated in lichenized Nostoc, which resembles the repression of motility in Nostoc symbionts after they colonize symbiotic cavities of their plant hosts. Our results pave the way for a revival of cyanolichen ecophysiology in the omics era.",40794795

Fungal taxa such as <i>Russula</i>, <i>Trechispora</i>, and <i>Capronia</i> were enriched in RP and RS, highlighting their potential roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter (OM) decomposition, and symbiosis. In contrast, the SS exhibited greater fungal richness but lower specialization. Among bacteria, root-associated compartments were enriched with plant-beneficial genera such as <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, while bulk soil hosted more generalist taxa. Soil physicochemical analyses showed higher OM and total nitrogen in RS compared to SS, indicating root-driven enrichment. Correlation and network analyses identified strong links between specific fungal and bacterial taxa and key soil properties including pH, OM, and cation exchange capacity.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Strengthen or Weaken: Evolutionary Directions of Cross-Feeding After Formation.,"Interactions between species and the evolution of strains are important biotic factors determining the microbial community dynamics, with these two processes being deeply intertwined. Cross-feeding is a prevailing mutualistic interaction in natural microbial communities in which metabolites secreted by one microbe can be utilised by another. Constructing synthetic microbial consortia based on cross-feeding is a promising strategy for bioremediation and bioproduction. But how to improve the performance and the stability of consortia remains a challenge. This review discusses the features of two opposite evolutionary directions of cross-feeding consortia over time, providing insights into the factors affecting the evolutionary process. While coevolving, cross-feeding may strengthen with stronger metabolic coupling, deeper growth dependence, and/or deeper evolutionary dependence; then the consortia become reinforced. Conversely, unsuitable environmental conditions can lead to the direct collapse of the cross-feeding consortia due to metabolic decoupling, partner extinction, or cheater dominance. The loss of the fitness advantage and the constraints on the evolutionary ability can also lead to the weakening of cross-feeding. Cross-feeding partners can affect the evolution of focal strains from different aspects, such as niche space, selective pressure, horizontal gene transfer, and evolutionary rate. Analysing cross-feeding from an evolutionary perspective will advance our understanding of microbial community dynamics and enable rational designs of efficient and stable synthetic microbial consortia.",40784676

Many symbiotic genes are located on the 1,354 kb pSymA megaplasmid of <i>S. meliloti</i> Rm1021. We recently constructed a minimalized pSymA, minSymA2.1, that lacked over 90% of the pSymA genes. Relative to the wild-type, minSymA2.1 showed a reduction in <i>M. sativa</i> shoot biomass production and nodule size with an increase in total nodule number. Here we show that the addition of either the stachydrine (<i>stc</i>) or trigonelline (<i>trc</i>) catabolism genes from pSymA to minSymA2.1 restores nodule size and total nodule number to levels indistinguishable from the wild-type but does not restore reduced shoot biomass production. In the context of the complete Rm1021 genome, removing the <i>stc</i> genes reduced nodule size and increased total nodule number while removal of the <i>trc</i> genes alone had no apparent effect. Together, these observations implicate stachydrine catabolism as an important determinant of root nodule symbiosis between <i>S. meliloti</i> and <i>M. sativa</i> while trigonelline catabolism seems to contribute in a more conditional manner, in the context of the minimized genome. These findings highlight the minimal symbiotic genome as a tool for investigating the impact individual genetic determinants have in conferring an optimal symbiosis.

While they retain genes beneficial to the host, their repertoire of transcription factors is severely reduced. Here, we assessed whether genome-eroded symbionts canstill regulate gene expression by characterizing the transcriptional responses of obligate symbionts in reed beetles to different temperatures and host life stages. These symbionts feature a small genome (~0.5Mb), encoding for 9-10 essential amino acid biosynthesis pathways, 0-2 pectinases, and 4-5 transcription factors. We found that the symbionts respond to winter conditions by upregulating a heat-shock sigma factor and downregulating translation machinery. Across life stages, symbionts adjusted gene expression to meet the hosts' nutritional demands, upregulating amino acid biosynthesis in larvae, while expression and activity of host and symbiont enzymes involved in plant cell wall breakdown increased in the folivorous adults. In addition, the regulation of symbiont cell morphology genes corresponded to cell shape differences across life stages.

To explore this mechanism, we sequenced and analyzed seven <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> genomes, identifying putative T3Es across five T3SS groups (G.1-G.5), which were classified based on the sequence of <i>rhcN</i>, a conserved ATPase gene essential for T3SS function. Phylogenetic analysis of <i>rhcN</i> more closely reflected the evolutionary relationships of nodulation genes than those based on 16S rRNA or whole-genome comparisons, underscoring its symbiotic relevance. Functional assays using <i>rhcN</i> mutants revealed group-specific effects on nodulation; G.1 strains showed neutral effects on <i>A. hypogaea</i>, negative effects on <i>V. radiata</i>, and positive effects on <i>V. mungo</i>. G.2 strains consistently promoted nodulation across all hosts and lacked effectors related to SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) pathways, which have been implicated in host defense regulation.

AMF improves host plant performance through enhanced phosphorus, nitrogen, and water uptake via extensive extraradical hyphal networks. Moreover, AMF colonization modulates phytohormonal signaling pathways, including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, and nitric oxide, priming SR and upregulating defense-related gene expression.

The circular genome (190,579 bp) lacks the canonical quadripartite structure (LSC/IR/SSC) and exhibits a strong AT bias (56.1%). Annotation identified 110 functional genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 28 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs. Repetitive sequence analysis revealed 5,000 dispersed repeats (2.62% of the genome), predominantly forward and palindromic types, with SSR loci showing a significant A/T preference. Codon usage analysis demonstrated a pronounced bias toward A/U-ending codons (RSCU > 1), suggesting translational adaptation to symbiotic nutrient constraints.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Dual-transcriptomics on microdissected cells reveals functional specialisation of symbiont-bearing-cells and contrasted responses to nutritional stress in the cereal weevil.,"Insects thriving on a nutritionally imbalanced diet often establish long-term relationships with intracellular symbiotic bacteria (endosymbionts), which complement their nutritional needs and improve their physiological performances. Endosymbionts are in host specialised cells, called the bacteriocytes, which in many insects group together to form a symbiotic organ, the bacteriome. The cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae houses multiple bacteriomes at the adult mesenteric caeca. Using microscopic cell imaging, we revealed that bacteriomes consist of several cell types, including progenitor cells, peripheral bacteriocytes, central bacteriocytes and epithelial cells. By combining laser capture microdissection and dual RNA-sequencing, we showed that both host cell types and their associated endosymbionts express distinct transcriptional profiles. The comparison between peripheral bacteriocytes and midgut cells from insects artificially deprived from endosymbionts (aposymbiotic) unravelled cellular pathways modulated by the presence of endosymbionts. The cell-specific response to endosymbionts in peripheral bacteriocytes includes a boost of fatty-acid and amino acid metabolisms. We found that central bacteriocytes overexpress transport and G-protein signalling-related genes when compared to peripheral bacteriocytes, indicating a signalling and/or transport function of these cells. Diet composition strongly impacts host and endosymbiont gene expression and reveals a molecular trade-off among metabolic pathways. This study provides evidence on how endosymbionts interfere and enhance metabolic performances of insect bacteriocytes and highlights key genes involved in the bacteriocyte differentiation and metabolic pathways.

We tested three transplantation methods, iron staples, coconut fiber mats, and BESE elements, and compared them with control meadows and donor populations from two different origins: naturally uprooted storm-fragments and intermatte cuttings manually harvested from established meadows. Our results show that transplantation methods strongly shape bacterial communities in seagrass roots. Iron staples promoted microbial assemblages most similar to natural meadows, likely due to direct sediment contact enhancing recruitment of key functional bacterial orders such as Chromatiales and Desulfobacterales. In contrast, BESE elements and coconut fiber mats displayed dissimilar bacterial communities compared to control meadows, likely due to material composition and physical separation between the cuttings and the sediment. Donor origin had only subtle effects on bacterial communities' structure, although intermatte cuttings showed higher abundances of Candidatus Thiodiazotropha, a genus thought to be involved sulfur oxidation and nitrogen fixation. Our results demonstrate that transplantation methods strongly influence root-associated bacterial communities. Limited sediment contact in elevated substrates delayed the establishment of key functional bacteria, highlighting the importance of direct interaction with the sediment microbial pool. These results imply that restoration strategies should prioritize methods enhancing sediment-root interactions to support microbial recovery. Incorporating microbiome considerations, such as optimized substrates or microbial inoculation, could improve the resilience and long-term success of P. oceanica restoration.",40770781
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Counting cytoplasmic incompatibility factor mRNA using digital droplet PCR.,"<i>Wolbachia</i> bacteria inhabit over half of all insect species and often spread through host populations via efficient maternal transmission and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), killing aposymbiotic embryos when fertilized by symbiotic males. <i>Wolbachia</i>'s <i>cifB</i> gene triggers CI in males, while <i>cifA</i>, expressed in females, rescues embryos from CI-induced lethality. In some systems, <i>cifA</i> also contributes to CI induction. CI strength-the percentage of embryos that die from CI-is a key determinant of <i>Wolbachia</i>'s prevalence in host populations, and <i>cifB</i> mRNA levels in testes generally correlate with CI strength. Yet, <i>cifB</i>'s rarity can hamper precise quantification, necessitating tissue pooling for reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to achieve reliable measurements, obscuring variation at the level of individual insect tissues. Here, we present four RT digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) assays to count rare <i>cifA</i> and <i>cifB</i> mRNA from <i>w</i>Mel <i>Wolbachia</i> in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. These assays count <i>cif</i> transcripts alongside a synthetic spike-in RNA or a <i>D. melanogaster</i> housekeeping gene to normalize for technical or biological variation.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",The sucrose transporter GmSWEET3c drives soybean nodulation by regulating root sucrose allocation.,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, driven by the interaction between rhizobia and host plants, provides essential nitrogen for plant growth but demands substantial energy. Sucrose, the principal product of photosynthesis, is critical in supporting this process. Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying sucrose allocation following rhizobia inoculation remain poorly understood. Here, we identified and characterized GmSWEET3c, a rhizobia-induced sucrose transporter that is critical for sucrose allocation to the root susceptible zone. Functional analysis of the Gmsweet3c mutant revealed impaired sucrose allocation and a significant reduction in nodule formation, underscoring its critical role in symbiotic nodulation. Using a GmSWEET3c-GFP fusion protein, we found that the protein is located in both the plasma membrane of root cells and the membranes of infection threads, suggesting dual roles of GmSWEET3c in facilitating sucrose transport to the root susceptible zone and directing sucrose toward infection threads. Moreover, we demonstrated that GmNSP1, a key symbiotic transcription factor, directly binds to the promoter region of GmSWEET3c, activating its expression. Collectively, our findings highlight GmSWEET3c as a key mediator of sucrose distribution in soybean roots after rhizobia inoculation, enhancing our understanding of carbohydrate allocation in legume-rhizobia symbioses.",40763740

In this study, a food intervention study was conducted to test whether a food intervention approach targeting intestinal microbiota can improve cognitive function in elderly Japanese individuals. Japanese participants (144 males and 87 females) aged 60-79 years were assigned to one of the test food groups: Tamogitake mushroom (<i>Pleurotus cornucopiae</i> var. <i>citrinopileatus</i>), <i>Moringa oleifera</i> Lam. leaves, and rice bran for each sex, respectively. After 4 weeks of pre-observation, each group consumed the test foods for 8 weeks; cognitive function and intestinal microbiota tests were performed after each 4-week period. The intestinal microbiota of each participant was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The participants were divided into responders (improved cognitive function) and non-responders (no improvement) within each sex group.

In the course of evolution, the perception-action functional cycles described by Jakob von Uexkll become complemented by the secondary meta-cycles, which perceive the work of the primary cycles, and finally by tertiary cycles of meta-reflexivity, which perceive and evaluate the previous activity of the secondary functional cycles and generate a new field of meanings associated with conscious experience. The development of secondary and tertiary cycles forms the basis of higher-level codes operating over the genetic system and resulting in the evolutionary separation between unikonts and bikonts, in the divergence between protostomes and deuterostomes, in all events of cellular differentiation manifested as differentiation trees, and finally in the appearance of consciousness. The expansion of codes associated with the rise of eukaryotic organelles and with the cytoskeleton rearrangements in the ontogenesis of multicellular organisms determines the course of the evolutionary process toward complexification. The internally controlled recombination process, in particular, in the course of meiotic cell division and ontogenetic differentiation, becomes the driving factor of progressive evolution. It corresponds to the growing role of the epigenome and epigenetic regulation in the complexification of biological organization. It is concluded that the evolutionary process unfolds as a propagating non-deducible construction following the generation of functional redundancy, which is achieved through gene duplication, symbiosis, and cell-cell interactions, and becomes an important precondition for the appearance of new evolutionary acquisitions.",40752570

Here we studied the physiological and transcriptomic responses of the coral Stylophora pistillata exposed to four different concentration combinations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) over a period of eight weeks. Despite no significant effects on coral growth or calcification, corals from low P conditions bleached and had significantly fewer symbionts than those from high-phosphate treatments. Low P concentrations induced upregulation of ion transmembrane transporter activity, and downregulation of transcripts involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, protein processing, and protein maturation. Further, all enriched biological processes were related to phosphate metabolism.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Chitooligosaccharide receptors modulate root microbiota to enhance symbiosis and growth in Medicago.,"Plant roots interact with beneficial microbes, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to aid in nutrient uptake. The interaction with AMF is initiated by plant Lysin motif (LysM) receptor-like kinases, CERK1 and LYR4 in Medicago truncatula, that detect AMF signals such as chitooligosaccharides (COs). However, the broader role of AMF-detecting receptors in shaping the root microbial community is largely unknown, and the impact of these receptor-mediated microbial communities on the AMF symbiosis is yet to be determined. This study examines the effects of CERK1 and LYR4 mutations on the root bacterial community, showing that these receptors have significant effects on shaping the bacterial community. Using bacteria isolated from wild-type roots, we created a synthetic bacterial community (SynCom), CO-SynCom. Plants inoculated with CO-SynCom exhibited significantly enhanced growth and AMF colonization in a manner dependent on the CO receptors LYR4 and CERK1, likely due to CERK1- and LYR4-mediated changes in hormone-related pathways and activation of symbiosis signaling. Our results highlight the essential role of plant symbiotic receptors in shaping root microbiota and offer valuable insights into optimizing plant-microbe interactions to enhance symbiosis and support sustainable agriculture.",40749676

The effects of adding 0.8M exogenous C8-HSL on biofilm formation and the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal were investigated by comparing systems with and without the signaling molecule. Results showed that 0.8M C8-HSL enhanced the removal efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) by 25.17%, 36.22%, and 38.74%, respectively, and increased extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production by 68.62%. High-throughput sequencing identified Desulfomicrobium and Aliidiomarina as the dominant microorganisms involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The nirB gene played a key role in the denitrification process, and phoBR gene was essential for phosphorus removal.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Depuration of a solitary ascidian depletes transient bacteria without altering microbiome alpha-diversity.,"Depuration, or the process of clearing impurities from the gut, is commonly applied to marine food products due to its efficacy in removing human pathogens from shellfish and edible ascidians. Recent studies also reported that depuration of filter-feeding animals helped reduce transient bacteria and identify resident symbionts in gut microbiome studies. Here, we examined the impact of depuration on bacteria in the branchial sac, gut, and hepatic gland of the solitary ascidian Pyura vittata. Replicates were kept in filtered seawater for 4 days prior to dissection (aquaria-depuration) and compared to samples that were immediately processed following collection (wild-no depuration) and replicates kept in unfiltered seawater for 4 days (aquaria-control). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed no significant differences among ascidian sources for microbial alpha-diversity but significant shifts in beta-diversity. Depuration reduced the number of core bacteria markedly (66%-84%) across all body regions, and bacteria that remained postdepuration consisted of genera associated with enhanced host health and resilience within other marine symbioses. Our results suggest that microbial profiles obtained following depuration do not substantially differ from those of nondepurated animals, but depuration can help differentiate transient from core and resident taxa in complex host-microbiome symbioses.",40742382

Among well-studied PGPB, <i>Azospirillum brazilense</i> Ab-V5 and <i>Pseudomonas protegens</i> Pf-5 are two well-known bacterial strains renowned for their growth-enhancing capacity and extensively used as bio-inputs. Many cereals, such as maize, produce indole-derived benzoxazinoids (BXs), specialized metabolites that shape root-associated microbiomes to promote colonization by plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). Although the mechanisms by which BXs recruit PGPB remain unclear, we hypothesize that BXs directly facilitate root colonization by favoring bacteria adapted to these metabolites in the soil environment. In this study, we investigated the impact of the relatively stable lactam BX-derivative, 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA), on two PGPB strains: <i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> Ab-V5 and <i>Pseudomonas protegens</i> Pf-5. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MBOA had minimal effects on Pf-5, but triggered extensive gene expression changes in Ab-V5, particularly in pathways related to energy metabolism, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation. Subsequent assays confirmed that MBOA acts as a chemoattractant for Ab-V5 and, at moderate concentrations, enhances both biofilm formation and colonization of <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. We propose that the chemotactic property of MBOA on Ab-V5 can enhance its establishment in the rhizosphere and that this metabolite can trigger the metabolic transition required for root colonization. In this paper, we studied the impact of benzoxaziniods on root colonization mechanisms of two potent plant-growth- promoting bacterial strains. We explored these mechanisms by an RNA sequencing experiment and by microscopy. The paper highlights how biofilm is particularly affected and reports on chemotactic responses. Most of the results we obtained we could validate with phenotypic assays. We show that benzoxazinoids, produced by many cereals, profoundly affect bacterial behavior related to plant-bacterial interactions. The bacteria in this study are known for their ecological roles in the soil, being either in plant protection or as biofertilizers.

In this study, we investigated the plant growth-promoting effects of the <i>Epichlo</i> endophyte strain and identified the growth of the <i>Epichlo</i> strain under different types of nitrogen source treatments. In addition to the in vitro test, we evaluated growth performance for <i>Epichlo</i> endophyte-infected plants (E+) and <i>Epichlo</i> endophyte-free plants (E-) in a pot trial under 0.01 mol/L urea treatment. Seedlings from E+ and E- groups were collected to analyze the plant bacterial microbiome and root metabolites. The <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte strain was found not to produce indoleacetic acid (IAA), pectinase, or contain ferritin. The nitrogenase gene, essential for nitrogen fixation, was also absent. These results suggest that <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte strains themselves do not contain attributes to promote plant growth. Concerning N fertilization, it was observed an increase in the colony diameter of <i>E. gansuensis</i> strain was observed only in the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (NN) treatment, while inhibition was observed in the urea-N (UN) treatment. <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte symbiosis significantly increased tiller number and plant dry weight. Overall, our results suggest that the E+ plants had more root forks and greater average root diameter compared to E- plants under the UN treatment. In a pot experiment using UN, data from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte infection significantly altered the bacterial community composition in shoot and root, and significantly increased Shannon (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and Chao 1 (<i>p</i> < 0.01) indexes. The relative abundance of Acidobacteriota, Actinomycetota, Cyanobacteriota, Fibrobacterota, Myxococcota, and Patescibacteria in the shoot, and Cyanobacteriota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota in the root were significantly increased by <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte infection. Similarly, <i>E. gansuensis</i> endophyte symbiosis shifted the metabolite composition of the host plants, with the E+ plants showing a higher number of metabolites than the E- plants. In addition, co-metabolism network analysis revealed that the positive relevance between exudates and microorganisms in the root of the E+ plants is higher than that of the E- plants.

Although M. exilis has an endobiotic lifestyle, it can be cultured in vitro in polyxenic conditions alongside an uncharacterized prokaryotic community, while attempts to create axenic cultures have not been successful. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to characterize the microbial consortium that supports the growth of M. exilis. We assembled genomes for 24 bacterial species and identified at least 30 species in total. M. exilis accounted for less than 1.5% of the DNA reads, while bacterial species dominated the sequence data and shifted in abundance over time. Our metabolic reconstruction and differential gene expression analyses show that the bacterial community relies on organic carbon oxidation, fermentation, and hydrogen production, but does not engage in methanogenesis. We observed rapid depletion of amino acids, nucleotides, glyceraldehyde, lactate, fatty acids, and alcohols in the medium, indicating a reliance on external nutrient recycling. The nitrogen cycle in this community is incomplete, with limited nitrogen fixation and no ammonia oxidation. Despite detailed metabolic profiling, we did not find any direct biochemical connections between M. exilis and the prokaryotes. Several bacterial species produce siderophores to assist themselves and others in the community in acquiring iron. However, M. exilis does not appear to benefit directly from siderophore-mediated iron transport and lacks known iron uptake pathways. This indicates that M. exilis may rely indirectly on the iron metabolism of other bacteria through phagocytosis. Additionally, some bacteria synthesize polyamines like spermidine and phosphatidylcholine, which M. exilis may need but cannot produce on its own. As the culture ages, M. exilis shows changes in gene expression consistent with starvation responses, including the upregulation of carbohydrate storage pathways and processes related to exocytosis. These findings provide new insights into microbial interactions within xenic cultures and emphasize the complex nature of maintaining amitochondriate eukaryotes in vitro.",40731366

The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence-absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules. Functionally our results point to management of oxidative stress, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, and NCR peptide signaling mechanisms in driving symbiotic outcomes.

Vertical transmission of a microbial symbiont from parent to offspring can produce extreme evolutionary consequences, including metabolic codependence, genome reduction, and synchronized life cycles. One of the few examples of vertical transmission of N-fixing symbionts occurs in Azolla ferns, which maintain an obligate mutualism with the cyanobacterium Trichormus azollae-but the genomic consequences of this interaction, and whether the symbiosis involves other vertically transmitted microbial partners, are currently unknown. We generated high-coverage metagenomes across the genus Azolla and reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes to investigate whether a core microbiome exists within Azolla leaf cavities, and how the genomes of T. azollae diverged from their free-living relatives. Our results suggest that T. azollae is the only consistent symbiont across all Azolla accessions, and that other bacterial groups are transient or facultative associates. Pangenomic analyses of T. azollae indicate extreme pseudogenization and gene loss compared to free-living relatives-especially in defensive, stress-tolerance, and secondary metabolite pathways-yet, the key functions of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis remain intact. Additionally, differential codon bias and intensified positive selection on photosynthesis, intracellular transport, and carbohydrate metabolism genes suggest ongoing evolution in response to the unique conditions within Azolla leaf cavities.

Mycena strains, as the main germinating fungi, can facilitate germination but cannot support the subsequent growth and development of GEB. It requires symbiotic interactions with Mycena and Armillaria mellea to obtain nutrients for its complex life cycle. Our previous studies have shown that trametenolic acid (TA) can effectively promote seed germination of GEB. The aim of this study was to use transcriptome sequencing to further understand the potential mechanism of seed germination triggered by TA in GEB, in order to lay the groundwork for developing a new germination-growth system for GEB with Armillaria mellea. The untreated symbiotic group (Group A<sub>0</sub>) did not germinate in the seed germination test. The high-dose TA-treated symbiotic group (Group B), the low-dose TA-treated symbiotic group (Group C), and the non-symbiotic untreated germination group (Group A) had germination rates of 85.01, 61.18 and 27.39%, respectively. This indicates that TA treatment can induce symbiosis with Armillaria mellea in GEB seeds and significantly increase germination rates. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of Groups A, B, and C identified 86,843 annotated genes. There were more down-regulated genes than up-regulated genes, with 3912, 2518, and 814 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between B and A, C and A, and B and C, respectively. The DEGs were mainly involved in DNA transcription factors, cell wall actions, plant-pathogen interactions, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phytohormone signal transduction, and starch-sucrose metabolism pathways. Six genes were confirmed using qRT-PCR: Down-regulated genes in the lignin biosynthesis pathway include MYB4 and 4CL, while GA20ox1 in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway was also down-regulated. Up-regulated genes in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway are AIB and WRKY51, with MYB44 in the lignin biosynthesis pathway showing up-regulation. The transcriptomics results supported these expression patterns. Lignin, GA, and abscisic acid (ABA) levels were analyzed in GEB protocorms to understand how TA promotes germination. Results showed that groups B and C had lower lignin and ABA levels, but higher GA levels compared to group A. The study revealed that certain genes play a crucial role in promoting GEB seed germination through TA, by regulating gene expression to alter lignin content and hormone levels, breaking seed dormancy, facilitating seed-fungus interactions, and promoting symbiotic relationships with Armillaria mellea. TA modulates the expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and hormone signaling, leading to an increase in GA content and a decrease in ABA and lignin content. This helps seeds break dormancy and promote germination. Additionally, TA can enhance GEB's defense response against fungi by regulating plant-pathogen interaction genes. It also improves the interactions between GEB and Armillaria mellea, overcoming the technical challenges associated with using Armillaria mellea as a germinating fungus. This establishes a new symbiotic germination-growth system between Armillaria mellea and GEB, laying the foundation for further research on the molecular mechanisms of GEB seed germination.",40702084

Bacteria-algae interactions, as pivotal yet underexplored drivers of marine and freshwater carbon sinks, involve multiple mechanisms that amplify CO fixation and long-term storage. This review systematically describes the synergistic effects of bacteria-algae consortia spanning both microalgae (e.g., Chlorella vulgaris and Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and macroalgae (e.g., Macrocystis and Laminaria) on carbon sequestration. These effects include (1) molecular-level regulation (e.g., signal transduction via N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and horizontal gene transfer), (2) ecological facilitation of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) formation, and (3) biotechnological applications in wastewater treatment and bioenergy production. We highlight that microbial crosstalk increases algal photosynthesis by 20-40% and contributes to 18.9% of kelp-derived RDOC storage. Furthermore, engineered systems integrating algal-bacterial symbiosis achieve greater than 80% nutrient removal and a 22-35% increase in CO fixation efficiency (compared with axenic algal systems), demonstrating their dual role in climate mitigation and a circular economy. This review is the first to integrate molecular mechanisms (e.g., quorum sensing), ecological carbon transformation processes (e.g., the formation of RDOC), and applications in synthetic biology (e.g., CRISPR-engineered consortia) into a unified framework. Moreover, the novel strategy ""microbial interaction network optimization"" for enhancing carbon sinks is proposed. However, scalability challenges persist, including light limitations in photobioreactors and the ecological risks of synthetic consortia. By bridging microbial ecology with synthetic biology, this work provides a roadmap for harnessing bacteria-algae synergy to achieve carbon neutrality.",40701356
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Comparative transcriptomics uncovers poplar and fungal genetic determinants of ectomycorrhizal compatibility.,"Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis supports tree growth and is crucial for nutrient cycling and temperate and boreal ecosystems functioning. The establishment of functional ectomycorrhiza (ECM) first requires the association of compatible partners. However, host and fungal genetic determinants governing mycorrhizal compatibility are unknown. To identify such factors in poplar and its fungal associates, we mined existing and de novo tree and fungal transcriptional datasets. We identified co-expressed genes enabling ECM symbiosis at early and mature stages of the interaction. These sets of genes can be divided into general fungal-sensing and ECM-specific components. We highlight the importance of fungal modulation of plant JA-related defenses and the regulation of secretory pathways for ECM compatibility, including upregulation of key fungal small secreted proteins, the downregulation of plant secreted peroxidases, and the downregulation of plant cell wall remodeling proteins concomitantly with the upregulation of fungal glycosyl hydrolases acting on pectin. Not only gene regulation, but also its temporal scale and dynamics seem to play a crucial role for mycorrhizal compatibility. The expression profile of the host Common Symbiosis Pathway and nutrient transporters was also studied, revealing constitutive levels of expression and moderate upregulation in compatible ECM interactions. Overall, these results underscore the importance of novel biological functions during the establishment of ECM symbiosis, help us gain insights into the molecular events determining mycorrhiza compatibility, and serve as a data-rich transcriptomic resource to open new research questions in the field.",40700644

Developing this symbiotic capability in cereal crops like rice is a promising strategy to reduce dependency on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, but it is neither simple nor easy. To find whether legume-specific Nod Factor receptor genes are expressed in rice and whether they can change root hair morphology. We developed transgenic rice plants harbouring two NF receptor genes, a co-receptor gene and two NF binding proteins: MtLYK3, MtNFP, MtDMI2, LjLNP, and MtSYMREM1. When transgenic rice roots were inoculated with fluorescent Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti), colonization of bacteria was observed on the root surface. Still, it was reduced significantly in the presence of nitrogen in the media. Gene expression of all the five transgenes in the S.meliloti inoculated roots increased to 3.5 fold. Root hair deformation was also observed when transgenic rice roots were treated with purified SmNod Factor (SmNF), and the presence of nitrogen in the medium reduced the root hair deformation percentage. This study suggested that rice could interact with S. meliloti for colonization and gene expression and also could perceive the NF signal to deform root hair when the legume-specific NF receptor genes along with co-receptor gene and two NF binding proteins were present in the rice plant. This is an initial indication that rice roots can behave like a symbiotic legume if appropriate genes are transferred to it.",40694187
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Gene expression and regulatory networks provide new insights into the similarity between nitrogen fixing and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses.,"Although the evolutionarily younger nitrogen-fixing symbioses (NFS) occurring between plants and rhizobia are predominantly confined to legume species, they exhibit a series of highly conserved characteristics in common with the more ancestral arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). A growing number of symbiosis-regulated genes have been characterized through either genetic analysis or phylogenomic profiling. However, the underlying similarities and specificities of the transcription regulatory machinery in AMS and NFS remain largely unclarified. Here, we systematically profiled the gene expression changes in three legume species, namely Medicago truncatula, Glycine max, and Lotus japonicus, during AMS and NFS. Additionally, we investigated gene expression changes in three non-legume plants, Solanum lycopersicum, Zea mays, and Oryza sativa, during AMS. We identified thousands of genes that were activated by AMS or NFS in their respective host plants. Through comparative genomics analysis, we systematically explored the conservation and specificity of genes responsive to AMS or NFS. Employing M. truncatula and G. max as illustrative cases, we harnessed the XGboost machine-learning model to construct co-expression-based gene regulatory networks for AMS and NFS within these two species. Through this approach, we successfully illuminated the similarities and unique features of the two symbiotic types at the gene regulatory network level. Further, utilizing known symbiosis genes as queries, we pinpointed a multitude of genes that are intimately associated with AMS and NFS. Overall, via in-depth gene expression profiling and regulatory network analysis, our results indicate that, while NFS in legumes has regulatory circuits similar to those of AMS, there exist certain symbiosis type-specific molecular components.",40693735

Statins, commonly prescribed for lowering cholesterol, have recently shown potential anti-cancer effects. In this study, we explore how statin treatment influences lipid metabolism, gene expression, and proteomic profiles in colorectal cancer models. Our findings provide direct evidence that statins selectively modulate key components of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway, a major driver of adenoma formation, including members of the special AT-rich sequence-binding (SATB) protein family. We show that statin treatment downregulates SATB1, a known promoter of tumorigenesis in the context of Wnt activation, while simultaneously upregulating SATB2, which plays an opposing role. This reciprocal regulation shifts cellular phenotypes between epithelial and mesenchymal states in 3D spheroid models.

While this protein family has been extensively studied in plants in terms of structure and functionality, this research addresses a gap in knowledge about their evolution and origins in eukaryotic groups. Protein sequences were aligned, and phylogenetic relationships were inferred. Amino acid substitution model testing was performed using ProtTest. These results recovered six homologues of plant HSP100s, consistent with previous literature, and also two major lineages of fungal HSP100s. At least one of these two fungal homologues of HSP100 are present in all basal eukaryotic groups studied, indicating their origins at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny. HSP100homologs are also present in choanoflagellates (earliest diverging animal lineage), indicating they were later secondarily lost in all other metazoans. Plants have additional 3 copies of HSP100s, obtained from a cyanobacterial ancestor that was the endosymbiotic precursor to the chloroplast.

These fungi, as obligate symbionts, are capable of influencing molecular, biochemical, and metabolic pathways, leading to alterations in the concentrations of various molecules within the host plant. Recent studies have addressed the transcriptomic and metabolic modifications triggered by AMF in grapevines. These AMF-induced alterations are involved in cell transport, sugar metabolism, plant defense mechanisms, and increased tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stressors. Notably, the shikimate pathway exhibits heightened activity following AMF inoculation in grapevines, resulting in the accumulation of anthocyanins, flavonols, phenolic acids, and stilbenes. Phenolic compounds are the main metabolites influencing grape and wine quality attributes, such as color, flavor, and potential health benefits.

Short-range addition of acetate for bio-screening is essential for achieving this regulation. After bio-screening, enhanced partial nitrification and anammox performance were achieved within 47days. In the start-up phase, denitrifiers outcompeted nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) for nitrite utilization, thereby enhancing the inhibition of NOB. The relative abundance of anammox bacteria (AnAOB) was maintained at approximately 8.6% due to an increase in extracellular proteins, which was conducive to material exchange and symbiosis between denitrifiers and AnAOB. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that bio-screening induced mixotrophic metabolism of AnAOB, characterized by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in organic carbon and energy metabolism, thereby improving the stability of the anammox process.

As Wolbachia spreads, the frequency of the associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes tends to increase within the host population. Two distinct Wolbachia strains, wCI and wFem, are shared by two pierid butterfly sister species: Eurema mandarina and Eurema hecabe. The congruence of mtDNA phylogeny and Wolbachia infection status suggests hybrid introgression of mtDNA from E. hecabe to E. mandarina. This inference is based on the observation that uninfected E. mandarina have unique mtDNA haplotypes, distinct from the mtDNA haplotypes found in Wolbachia-infected E. mandarina and E. hecabe. In E. hecabe, Wolbachia infection has been considered fixed, with no expectation of uninfected individuals. Unexpectedly, Wolbachia-free E. hecabe individuals were discovered on the Yonaguni Island of Japan. We included these individuals in the phylogenetic analyses to reassess the impact of Wolbachia infection on Eurema butterflies. The nuclear Triosephosphate isomerase gene-based phylogenetic tree formed two discrete clades corresponding to E. mandarina and E. hecabe. Contrastingly, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene-based tree consisted of three clades, Wolbachia-free E. mandarina, Wolbachia-free E. hecabe, and a clade consisting of Wolbachia-infected E. mandarina and E. hecabe, as well as two other Eurema species, Eurema ada and Eurema lacteola. Our findings indicate that the mitochondria shared by E. mandarina and E. hecabe likely originate from a different species of Eurema (E. ada, E. lacteola, or others).

Significant differences in mite attachment duration were documented among 6 species of <i>Drosophila</i>, providing evidence for interspecific differentiation in attachment-resistance. Experiments with <i>D. malerkotliana</i>, a species exhibiting a relatively high rate of mite detachment, revealed that pre-infesting flies significantly reduced mite attachment duration compared to nave controls, indicating a priming effect.

Metabolic specialization was evident, such as potential adaptations to diverse carbon sources based on detection of one-carbon (C1) metabolic genes in eight genomospecies. Genes associated with defense, symbiosis/pathogenesis, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) were also distinct across genomospecies. For instance, Ca. T. taylori exhibited lower abundances of HGT-associated genes compared to other genomospecies, particularly Ca. T. endolucinida, Ca. T. lotti, and Ca. T. weberae. HGT-associated genes were linked to previously unreported retron-type reverse transcriptases, dsDNA phages, and phage resistance.

This study explores the presence and likely impact of Wolbachia bacteria in the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri. We detected Wolbachia in populations of ACP collected from Roodan (Ro) and Jahrom (Ja) in Iran and quantified their titers in different stages and tissues. Wolbachia titers were higher in the Ja population than the Ro population across stages and tissues. In both populations Wolbachia showed perfect vertical transmission. Based on the ftsZ gene, ACP Wolbachia belong to supergroup B. Using tetracycline treatment, we eliminated Wolbachia from ACP adults. However, the cured insects did not breed, preventing the establishment a Wolbachia-free line. We also crossed the Ja and Ro populations reciprocally and surprisingly found that the resultant eggs did not hatch although crosses of males and females within populations showed normal hatching. This suggests a bidirectional CI phenotype, likely as a result of different Wolbachia infections in the two populations. To test Wolbachia divergence further, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction high-resolution melting analysis targeting the ftsZ gene followed by ftsZ sequence analysis, which revealed differences in the Wolbachia strains from the two ACP populations. To characterize the reproductive phenotype further and consider its potential use to suppress ACP populations, we varied the proportions of males and females from the different populations and released them on lemon seedlings where hatch rates were recorded. The hatch rates varied from 84.851.8% in populations with an equal number of  and  from the Ro population to a low of 2.021.7% where there was a ratio of 1:1:10 (Ro:Ro:Ja) present, reflecting the expected strong bidirectional CI when Ja males were released at a high relative frequency into an Ro population.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Three decades of mobile RNA silencing within plants: what have we learnt?,"In plant RNA-silencing, small interfering (si)RNAs and micro (mi)RNAs guide ARGONAUTE (AGO) effector proteins to silence sequence-complementary RNA/DNA. This helps regulate developmental patterning, adaptation to stress, antiviral defense or genome integrity-maintenance. Remarkably, these regulations not only occur intra-cellularly, but may also manifest in remote tissues. Here, I summarize the evidence that RNA-silencing moves from cell-to-cell and via the phloem, the long-distance extension of the symplasm-the cytosolic connection-network between cells through plasmodesmata (PDs). I then illustrate several biological functions linked to RNA-silencing movement. Besides a still largely putative role for mobile virus-derived (v)siRNAs in conferring immunity, several endogenous sRNAs act as systemic signals orchestrating organismal responses to abiotic stress or symbiosis. Other mobile sRNAs act as morphogens and generate gene expression gradients by moving from cell-to-cell. If RNA-silencing indeed moves symplasmically via PDs, then processes likely regulate its transport; discovering these processes was expected to illuminate macromolecular trafficking in general. In a final part of this perspective, I describe several forward genetic systems set in Arabidopsis to specifically tackle the above issue. Some were instrumental in revealing hitherto unknown AGO-mediated mechanisms that modulate silencing movement within silencing-incipient, traversed or recipient cells. Somewhat disappointingly, however, the systems fell short of identifying factors impacting the silencing cell-to-cell trafficking channels or their regulations. I discuss here plausible reasons for these shortcomings, what could be learnt from them, how they could be remedied, and how a better understanding of their physiological foundations might illuminate so far overlooked aspects of plant RNA- silencing movement.",40629501

Complex, two-way communication governs the invasion of plant roots and the formation of nodules in which the rhizobia reduce N<sub>2</sub> to bioavailable ammonia. Research has uncovered many of the genes required for the symbiosis; however, engineering the symbiosis to function with alternative hosts such as cereal crops necessitates the establishment of a core set of symbiotic players. We examined the symbiotic relevance of the genes on the 1.68Mb pSymB chromid of the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti. By employing a strain in which pSymB was removed, we used a gain-of-function approach to assess a select group of known symbiotic regions totalling 261kb (15.5%) of pSymB. This gene set enabled symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation with alfalfa with a high degree of plant genotype-dependent variation in which nodules often senesced prematurely. We demonstrate that additional regions lacking canonical symbiosis genes are important for the efficient formation of symbiosis with the plant host. These regions appear to contain auxiliary symbiotic loci whose genes encode products with quasi-essential functions for the symbiosis and that are redundant in nature. We further established a 673-kb pSymB genome that engages consistently in N<sub>2</sub>-fixation with alfalfa with 45% efficiency.

Here, using <sup>15</sup>N tracing, amplicon, metagenome, and metatranscriptomic sequencing, we explore nitrogen (N) potential biogeochemistry across artificial and natural biofilms as well as the bulk seawater.

This functional shift corresponds to distinct microbial community structures, driven by active N-cycling taxa and metabolic pathway reconfigurations on plastic surfaces. We also observe that carbohydrate metabolism pathways, such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, were highly expressed in plastic biofilms, with transcriptional levels of glk (encoding glucokinase) and PGK (encoding phosphoglycerate kinase) increased by 6- and 2-fold, respectively.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Redefining the nitroplast: Recent insights into the endosymbiontto- organelle transition.,"One of the most remarkable events in cellular evolution is the endosymbiosis of -proteobacteria with a single archaean host cell, a rare evolutionary process, which eventually led to the transformation of symbionts into fully functional mitochondrial organelles in eukaryotes. Evolutionary events related to plants occurred almost 1.6 billion years ago, when eukaryotic heterotrophs acquired a -cyanobacterium (containing 1B RUBISCO) in what is termed as primary endosymbiosis. Further, this composite cell lineage evolved into three photosynthetic lineages: green algae (plants), red algae and the glaucophytes. Thereafter, a secondary, and tertiary endosymbiosis event occurred giving rise to distinct kinds of green and red-derived photosynthetic plastids, which can be observed in a few haptophytes and dinoflagellates respectively. Eventually, these endosymbionts acquired characteristic cellular properties such as two/multiple envelope membranes and reduction of their genomes through either loss or concerted endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) into the nucleus, which ultimately led to the decline of more than three quarters of coding capacity and complete loss of several metabolic pathways. This loss, however, is partly compensated by import of nuclearencoded proteins as well as proteins acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For most proteins, specific transport mechanisms from nucleus/cytoplasm to organelle exist. The proteins are typically translated as a preprotein with specific signal sequences targeted to the organelle membrane. These membranes harbour receptors, in some cases soluble receptors, for recognition of these signal sequences. Proteins are then internalised using a set of translocation machineries (Gould <i>et al.</i> 2006).",40619778

Gene expression analysis and inoculation tests indicated that pretreatment with rac-4BD promotes the effect of the SAR inducer BIT. Activation of SAR was also significantly observed in the SL and karrikin signal-deficient rice mutant d3.

In the present study, we found that miR399d homologues were consistently downregulated in multiple angiosperms during AMS. Genetic approaches were used to study its role in AMS in a tomato model. The overexpression of tomato miR399d significantly inhibited the colonization of plants by AMF and the development of arbuscules. A similar phenotype was observed by inactivation of PHO2 (PHOSPHATE2), a target gene of miR399d. Considering that both miR399d overexpression and PHO2 deficiency increase the accumulation of Pi transporters in the direct Pi uptake pathway, a Pi transporter gene PT1, which is involved in direct Pi uptake, was overexpressed in tomato. The resulting transgenic plants presented elevated direct Pi uptake and a decreased degree of AMF colonization. These findings suggest that the downregulation of miR399d is required for AMS establishment and that miR399d may act as a negative regulator of AMS by fine-tuning distinct Pi uptake pathways in tomato plants under phosphorus starvation conditions.",40614119

Cc was collected from a small sample of an outbreak swarm of Lnt in the peninsula area of Yonago City, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. This study compared the bacterial flora of Lnt and Cc, revealing distinct bacterial diversity shifts in these insect species between life stages. We analyzed the bacterial communities of adult and larval females of Cc and Lnt using MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene.

Festuca sinensis is an important cultivated forage grass found in high-altitude regions of China. Breeding forage varieties capable of maintaining high yields under nitrogen-deficient conditions is of great significance. Despite its ecological and agricultural importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of Festuca sinensis to nitrogen starvation, as well as the identification of key regulatory genes, remain largely unexplored. In this study, Festuca sinensis was cultured under different nitrogen concentrations using 1/2 Hoagland nutrient solution. Significant morphological differences were observed among the treatments, and physiological experiments confirmed that Festuca sinensis experienced substantial stress under low-nitrogen conditions. Subsequently, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted with four treatment groups and two plant tissue types.

Using laboratory-acclimatized thalli, we found that lichen fungal and algal symbionts show variable expression profiles between high- and low-elevation individuals: circadian- and temperature-associated genes for fungi and light-responsive genes for algae show climate-specific patterns. High- and low-elevation individuals differentially express sugar transporters in both symbionts, pointing to symmetrical and climate-dependent sugar transport mechanisms between them. A light pulse treatment identified asymmetries between fungal and algal light responses, with high- and low-elevation fungal symbionts but only low-elevation algal symbionts showing a response. Together, these results tie previously observed genomic variation along climatic gradients in a lichen species to functional differences in transcription for the fungal and algal symbionts, contributing to our understanding of environmental specialization and niche-specific partner combinations in lichens.",40592450
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Emerging concept of genomic islands in bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity.,"Genomic Islands (GEIs) are distinct DNA segments acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), driving bacterial evolution and adaptation. These include Pathogenicity Islands (PAIs), Symbiosis Islands, Antibiotic Resistance Islands, Xenobiotic-Degradation Islands, and Nitrogen Fixation Islands. GEIs contribute to genetic diversity, enhancing bacterial pathogenicity, symbiosis, antibiotic resistance, and xenobiotic degradation. Characterized by variations in GC content, codon bias, and integration sites, they distinguish themselves from the core genome. Advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics have deepened our understanding of GEIs in bacteria like Salmonella, Vibrio, E. coli, and many more, offering insights into microbial evolution, pathogenicity, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms.",40582582
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",From roots to nodules: regulation of organogenesis in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.,"Plants in the nitrogen-fixing clade have evolved symbiotic root nodules to overcome nitrogen limitations in the soil. These nodules host nitrogen-fixing bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, supplying essential nutrients to the plant. Nodule formation is triggered by plant-bacteria interactions and relies on genetic adaptations, including the recruitment of existing regulatory pathways. The transcription factor NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is a key regulator required for bacterial infection, nodule initiation, and organ differentiation. Nodule development shares key features with lateral root formation, particularly in organ initiation and early growth stages, as both arise from the same root tissue layers. This overlap raises intriguing questions about how nodules evolved distinct forms and functions. This review highlights recent discoveries in the molecular and cellular mechanisms of nodule development, especially in the Papilionoideae clade. By comparing nodules and lateral roots, we explore the regulatory changes that led to their evolutionary divergence. We highlight emerging tools-single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and advanced imaging-that are deepening insights into nodulation, alongside phylogenomics revealing its evolutionary history.",40582138

Biofilms offer protection against environmental stressors, immune responses, and antimicrobial treatments by increasing host colonization and resilience. This review examines the mechanisms of biofilm formation in <i>Vibrio</i> species, focusing on quorum sensing, cyclic-di-GMP signaling, and host-specific adaptations that influence biofilm structure and function. We discuss how biofilms differ between mutualistic and pathogenic species based on environmental and host signals. Recent advances in omics technologies such as transcriptomics and metabolomics have enhanced research in biofilm regulation under different conditions. Horizontal gene transfer and phase variation promote the greater fitness of bacterial biofilms due to the diversity of environmental isolates that utilize biofilms to colonize host species. Despite progress, questions remain regarding the long-term effects of biofilm formation and persistence on host physiology and biofilm community dynamics. Research integrating multidisciplinary approaches will help advance our understanding of biofilms and their implications for influencing microbial adaptation, symbiosis, and disease.

There is a scarcity of data regarding the presence of gastric mucosa-associated dysbiosis in functional dyspepsia. The present study aimed to characterize the taxonomy and diversities of the microbiota in the gastric mucosa of patients with functional dyspepsia. The study was conducted on a total of 50 paired antral and body gastric biopsies collected from the dyspepsia group (<i>n</i>=15) and control group (<i>n</i>=10). Microbial DNA was extracted from all gastric biopsies, followed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the Miseq Illumina platform. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroides were the most predominant phyla in both groups, with a significant overrepresentation of Proteobacteria in the dyspepsia group (<i>p</i> value=0.004). The genera <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Helicobacter</i> were the most prevalent in both groups. The species of <i>H. pylori</i> and <i>Prevotella melaninogenica</i> were significantly more abundant in the dyspepsia group. The species of The LEfSe analysis revealed that <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Helicobacter</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Bifidobacteria</i>, and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> were the most highly abundant and discriminating taxa in the gastric biopsies of the dyspepsia group compared to the control group. The microbial alpha diversity was significantly higher among gastric biopsies of dyspepsia than controls (<i>P</i>=0.031). The beta diversity showed microbial dissimilarity between samples of dyspepsia and the control group. The 16S rRNA gene NGS used in the present study demonstrated significant alteration in composition and diversities of gastric mucosa-associated microbiota among cases of functional dyspepsia compared to the controls. It is advisable to utilize advanced innovative technologies to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of disrupted microbiota in gastric disorders.

These conditions are characterized by rapid progression, poor prognosis, low survival rates, and limited treatment options. Few studies have suggested that genetic, environmental factors and inflammation contribute to the pathobiology of these complex disorders, however, the etiology of disease and progression remains unclear. A multicenter prospective longitudinal (3-time point) study will be conducted with a total sample size of 400 across all the groups (PSP, MSA, CBS). Patients with APS will be recruited after a detailed evaluation by movement disorder specialists and obtaining valid informed consent.

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Cell type-specific immune regulation under symbiosis in a facultatively symbiotic coral.,"Many cnidarians host single-celled algae within gastrodermal cells, yielding a mutually beneficial exchange of nutrients between host and symbiont, and dysbiosis can lead to host mortality. Previous research has uncovered symbiosis tradeoffs, including suppression of immune pathways in hosts, and correlations between symbiotic state and pathogen susceptibility. Here, we used a multiomic approach to characterize symbiotic states of the facultatively symbiotic coral Oculina arbuscula by generating genotype-controlled fragments of symbiotic and aposymbiotic tissue. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed no difference in bacterial communities between symbiotic states. Whole-organism proteomics revealed differential abundance of proteins related to immunity, confirming immune suppression during symbiosis. Single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within seven cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell clusters containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and lipid metabolism genes than aposymbiotic gastrodermal cells. Furthermore, differential enrichment of immune system gene pathways and lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation were observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, there were no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster between symbiotic states. We conclude that there is evidence for compartmentalization of immune system regulation in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis. This compartmentalization may limit symbiosis tradeoffs by dampening immunity in algal-hosting cells while simultaneously maintaining general organismal immunity.",40569035
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",ABA promotes fatty acid biosynthesis and transport to boost arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in apple roots.,"The roots of most land plants form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The fungus promotes nutrient uptake from the soil while receiving plant-derived photosynthates as lipids and sugars. Nutrient exchange must be regulated by both partners; however, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of lipid supply from the plant to the AM fungus remain unclear. Here, we performed a molecular study on the role of elevated abscisic acid (ABA) levels during AM fungal infection in apple (Malus spp.) roots. AM fungal colonization induced the expression of two ABA biosynthesis genes, MdNCED3.1 and MdNCED3.2, in apple roots and increased ABA content, which promoted AM fungal growth. The effect of ABA on symbiosis was confirmed in transgenic apple roots overexpressing or silencing MdNCED3.1 or MdNCED3.2. Transcriptome analysis and transgenic experiments revealed that the transcription factor MdABF2 plays a key role in ABA-mediated symbiosis during AM infection and regulates the expression of genes associated with fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis (e.g., MdKASIII) and transport (such as MdSTR2) in apple roots. Activation of these genes increased FA levels in roots and enhanced AM fungal colonization and arbuscule development. These findings identify a molecular pathway in which ABA signaling positively regulates FA biosynthesis and transport, thereby increasing lipid supply to AM fungi and promoting AM symbiosis.",40566686
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",ATP requirements for growth reveal the bioenergetic impact of mitochondrial symbiosis.,"Studies by microbiologists in the 1970s provided robust estimates for the energy supply and demand of a prokaryotic cell. The amount of ATP needed to support growth was calculated from the chemical composition of the cell and known enzymatic pathways that synthesize its constituents from known substrates in culture. Starting in 2015, geneticists and evolutionary biologists began investigating the bioenergetic role of mitochondria at eukaryote origin and energy in metazoan evolution using their own, widely trusted-but hitherto unvetted-model for the costs of growth in terms of ATP per cell. The more recent model contains, however, a severe and previously unrecognized error that systematically overestimates the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis up to 200-fold. The error applies to all organisms studied by such models and leads to conspicuously false inferences, for example that the synthesis of an average amino acid in humans requires 30 ATP, which no biochemistry textbook will confirm. Their ATP 'cost' calculations would require that E. coli obtains ~100 ATP per glucose and that mammals obtain ~240 ATP per glucose, untenable propositions that invalidate and void all evolutionary inferences so based. By contrast, established methods for estimating the ATP cost of microbial growth show that the first mitochondrial endosymbionts could have easily doubled the host's available ATP pool, provided (i) that genes for growth on environmental amino acids were transferred from the mitochondrial symbiont to the archaeal host, and (ii) that the host for mitochondrial origin was an autotroph using the acetyl-CoA pathway. Stated in simple terms, the significance of these findings are this: Life is a chemical reaction. It requires energy release in order to proceed. The currency of energy in cells is adenosine triphosphate, ATP. Five decades ago, microbiologists were able to measure and understand the amount of ATP that cells require to grow. New studies by evolutionary biologists have appeared in the meantime that brush aside the older microbiological findings, using their own methods to calculate the ATP cost of growth instead. Science is, however, an imperfect undertaking. The new studies contain a major error, similar to conflating centimeters with yards. The error affects many publications and their conclusions. Using the old methods, we can still meaningfully study the role of energy in evolution, including the origin of complex, nucleus-bearing cells.",40562331

Phosphate transporters, especially the PHT1 family, are crucial for plant phosphorus absorption, transport, and redistribution. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Acer truncatum PHT1 genes in phosphorus transport. We cloned five PHT1 family genes (AtPT1, AtPT2, AtPT4, AtPT9, and AtPT11) and investigated their expression and function under varying phosphorus regimes in the context of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis with Rhizophagus irregularis. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed differential gene expression patterns in response to AM colonization and phosphorus levels. Functional characterization through yeast complementation, tobacco overexpression, subcellular localization, and GUS reporter gene assays confirmed the plasma membrane localization and typical PHT1 family traits of these transporters. AM colonization upregulated AtPT4 and AtPT11, with AtPT11 having a specific induction pattern for mycorrhizal phosphorus acquisition. AtPT4 was linked to phosphorus uptake via mycorrhizal symbiosis, AtPT1 is involved in phosphorus remobilization within plant tissues, AtPT2 in phosphorus transport and remobilization (suppressed by AM colonization), and AtPT9 in phosphorus uptake and transport efficiency under high-phosphorus conditions. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying phosphorus homeostasis in Acer truncatum and its mycorrhizal interactions.",40556045

Thereafter, the ability of the TF strains to alter the TME was characterized in vivo in an orthotopic murine model of triple-negative breast cancer to assess therapeutic effects. The TF strains altered the TME by shifting immune cell composition and attenuating tumor growth. Additionally, multiple doses of the TF strains were well-tolerated by the mice. The use of <i>B. subtilis</i> LLO TF strains as EES showed promise as a unique cancer immunotherapy by directing the immune function intracellularly.

Although they are the second most abundant coral group on tropical reefs and contribute significantly to the structural complexity of Mediterranean coral reefs, their microbial dynamics are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the acquisition of the bacterial microbiota in the red coral Corallium rubrum, a precious coral.

First, we assembled the genome of <i>Candidatus</i> Krakonobacterium acarorum (formerly the <i>Soliltalea</i>-like symbiont SOL), a novel lineage of the Bacteroidota symbiont of mites. The assemblage SOL genome (1.2 Mb) contained complete pathways for the biosynthesis of lipoic acids, pantothenate, and menaquinone from futalosine. SOL is considered a facultative inhabitant (with prevalences ranging from 36% to 80% among individuals) of the gut (from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> copies/mite) that is not detected in eggs, suggesting an extracellular location in the gut of mites. Second, gene expression was analyzed in SOL-inhabited cultures, including two cultures with cTPut and two cultures without cTPut. Correlation-based evidence for competition between cTPut and SOL was found mainly in the expression of transporter proteins. The presence of cTPut decreased interactions between SOL and the mite host; however, SOL is under greater control by mites in the presence of cTPut than in the absence of cTPut. Mite KEGG gene expression levels in the peroxisome, autophagy, sphingolipid, apoptosis, PI3K-Akt, and lysozyme pathways were more strongly correlated with SOL gene expression in cultures without cTPut than in those with cTPut. In contrast, mite KEGG gene expression levels in the proteasome, NF-B, TNF, calcium, and Rap1 signaling pathways were more strongly correlated with SOL in the presence of cTPut. The explanation for these results is that cTPut mostly interacts with the mite host, resulting in changes in the host's immunity-related/regulatory pathways, indirectly affecting the symbiont SOL. Here, we describe the novel Bacteroidetes symbiont (SOL) of mites. The analysis of gene expression in meta-transcriptomic samples from cultures with and without the intracellular parasite <i>Cardinium</i> revealed the effect of <i>Cardinium</i> on SOL as a model facultative symbiont of mites.

To expand our understanding of the tick symbiont <i>Midichloria mitochondrii</i> and <i>Rickettsia helvetica</i>, which has been linked to disease in humans, we utilized deep sequencing on 16 individual adult female ticks collected from coastal dune and forested areas in the Netherlands. By employing a combination of second- and third-generation sequencing techniques, we successfully reconstructed the complete genomes of <i>M. mitochondrii</i> from 11 individuals, <i>R. helvetica</i> from eight individuals, and the mitochondrial genome from all ticks. Additionally, we visualized the location of <i>R. helvetica</i> in tick organs and constructed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of both symbionts to study their environmental dependencies. Our analysis revealed a strong cophylogeny between <i>M. mitochondrii</i> and mitochondrial genomes, suggesting frequent maternal transmission. In contrast, the absence of cophylogeny between <i>R. helvetica</i> and the mitochondrial genomes, coupled with its presence in the receptaculum seminis of <i>I. ricinus</i> females, raises the possibility of paternal transmission of <i>R. helvetica</i>. Notably, the genetic diversity of <i>R. helvetica</i> was found to be very low, except for the rickA virulence gene, where the presence of up to 13 insertions of a 33 nt-long repeat led to significant variability. However, this variation could not account for the differences in infection prevalence observed across eight distinct locations in the Netherlands. By employing deep sequencing, it becomes feasible to extract complete genomes and genetic data of symbionts directly from their host organisms. This methodology serves as a robust means to gain fresh insights into their interactions. Our observations, which suggest paternal transmission of <i>R. helvetica</i>, a relatively unexplored mode of transmission in ticks, require validation through experimental investigations. The genetic variations identified in the rickA virulence gene of <i>R. helvetica</i> have the potential to influence the infectivity and transmission dynamics of <i>R. helvetica</i>.IMPORTANCETicks are vectors of numerous human pathogens; however, the microbial interactions within ticks and the mechanisms governing pathogen transmission remain poorly understood. This study uses deep sequencing of individual <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> to reconstruct high-quality genomes of endosymbionts and the mitochondrion of the tick, revealing previously undetected microbial dynamics. Notably, we recovered low-abundance <i>Rickettsia</i> and <i>Midichloria</i> genomes from single ticks and present evidence that suggests paternal transmission of <i>R. helvetica</i>. These findings offer novel insights into the ecology and evolution of tick-associated microbes and have implications for understanding the origins and spread of tick-borne diseases.",40521888
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi confer aluminum toxicity tolerance in Ricinus communis via modulating root metabolic mechanisms and the composition and quantity of root exudates.,"Aluminum (Al) phytotoxicity is an essential factor that severely threatens plant productivity in acidic soil with pH<5. Nevertheless, the specific interactions and functional contributions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) in the adaptability of Ricinus communis to Al stress remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the changes in biomass, Al accumulation, antioxidant system, sucrose metabolism, gene expression, and root exudates of R. communis when regulated by AMF (Rhizophagus intraradices, Funneliformis mosseae, and Diversispora versiformis) under Al stress (0-1.2gkg<sup>-1</sup>). Al detoxification by AMF - R. communis symbiosis was manifested by activating antioxidant levels, sucrose metabolism, thereby alleviating lipid peroxidation (MDA decreased 11.44%-24.89%) and increasing plant biomass (10.34%-33.33%). Meanwhile, transcriptome analysis revealed 659 differentially expressing genes (DEGs) in AMF-inoculated plants in comparison to non-inoculated plants subjected to Al stress. Furthermore, AMF colonization induced 929 differential metabolites (DAMs) from the perspective of root exudates. The integrating analysis of gene expression and root exudate changes indicating that AMF colonization under Al stress was closely related to ABC transporters, glutathione metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism. Altogether, the result of this study suggest that AMF confer Al tolerance to R. communis via antioxidant activation, sucrose metabolism regulation, and reshaping root exudates and gene networks. The present study provides new insights into the crucial role of AMF in improving Al-tolerance of R. communis.",40517638

Our study revealed a distinct clade differentiation between non-pigmented and pigmented <i>Porphyromonas</i> species. Unlike <i>P. gingivalis</i>, the pulmonary POTG strains lacked known virulence genes, with the exception of a putative haemolysin gene. Regarding antibiotic resistance, notable resistances were limited to vancomycin in <i>P. catoniae</i> and clindamycin in <i>P. uenonis</i>. These findings support the hypothesis that POTG species may predominantly behave as commensals in the lung environment rather than as pathogens.",40512666

Understanding factors influencing this interaction is crucial for cultivation. This study investigates the non-target effects of the fungicide Fenaminosulf (FM) on <i>Z. latifolia</i>'s growth, physiology, and underlying molecular pathways. We demonstrate that FM exerts striking concentration-dependent effects, revealing its potential as a modulator of plant development and symbiosis. Physiological measurements showed that a moderate FM concentration (1.25 g/L) promoted key vegetative growth parameters, including plant height and leaf length, while maintaining chlorophyll content, suggesting a potential bio-stimulant effect. In contrast, higher FM concentrations (2.5 g/L and 5 g/L) inhibited vegetative growth but significantly enhanced gall formation, particularly at 2.5 g/L, indicating that FM can redirect plant resources or alter susceptibility to favor the fungal interaction under specific conditions. Transcriptomic analysis provided mechanistic insights, revealing extensive gene expression reprogramming, especially under high FM treatment (5 g/L). Key pathways related to plant-pathogen interaction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and hormone signal transduction were significantly modulated. Notably, FM treatment suppressed key immune-related genes, including <i>Xa21</i> and <i>PBL19</i>, potentially reducing plant resistance and facilitating gall formation. Hormone signaling analysis revealed inhibition of auxin, cytokinin, brassinosteroid, and jasmonic acid metabolism, indicating a comprehensive molecular recalibration of plant developmental processes. The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which FM influences <i>Z. latifolia</i> growth and gall formation. The concentration-dependent effects of FM suggest its potential as a strategic tool for agricultural management, offering a nuanced approach to crop development. These findings contribute to understanding plant-chemical interactions and provide valuable directions for optimizing <i>Z. latifolia</i> cultivation strategies.",40508303

Plant-fungal symbiosis is one of the most significant biotic interactions in the biosphere. The symbiotic association of fungi not only improves plant growth and resistance but has potential significance for endangered species conservation and reproduction. Alternative splicing is involved in regulating symbiotic responses to host immune signals, regulating the host-symbiont contact, and initiating signaling during symbiosis. In recent years, mRNAs research has been progressing rapidly, and AS is an important post-transcriptional regulator that requires further investigation. However, while AS has been widely studied in mammalian disease research, very limited studies are available on the regulation of AS in plant-fungal symbiosis and their role in benefiting the interacting partners. In this review, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge about AS in symbiotic plant-fungal relationships and discuss potential hotspots for future investigation to expand our understanding of plant-fungal interactions.",40508007

A collection of 212 strains of peanut rhizobia was obtained from six field sites in eastern, central, and northern Henan, Central China, by using peanut as a trap host under glasshouse conditions. PCR-RFLP analysis of ribosomal IGS sequences classified the 212 strains into 28 distinct types. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA, atpD, gyrB, dnaK, and rpoB genes from 30 representative strains of the 28 IGS types identified revealed the presence of Bradyrhizobium. liaoningense, B. yuanmingense, B. zhengyangense, and two novel Bradyrhizobium genospecies. This composition differs from the peanut rhizobia community found in southern Henan. B. liaoningense was the dominant species, covering 49% of the total isolates across the field sites, while B. zhengyangense accounting for 27%, B. yuanmingense for 7% and the two novel Bradyrhizobium genospecies for 17%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the symbiosis-related nodC and nifH gene sequences clustered into six groups: three associated exclusively with the peanut host (symbiovar arachidis and two unnamed group), three originating from other legume hosts (sv. glycinearum, cajani and retamae). Through the principal component analysis (PCA) between IGS types or species and soil physicochemical properties and environmental factors, it showed that IGS types 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18, and 21 positively correlated with AveTmax, AveTmin, AN and AP. IGS types 4, 11, 16, 17, 20, 25, and 26 were positively associated with Alt, AvePrecp, and pH. IGS types 2, 7, 10, 22, 24, and 27 correlated with AP, while remaining types exhibited correlations with OM. In addition, B. yuanmingense, B. liaoningense, and Bradyrhizobium genosp. I positively affected by AveTmax, AP, AN, and AK. Bradyrhizobium genosp. II positively correlated with AK, AN, and OM while B. zhengyangense mainly affected by AvePrecp and pH. The alkaline soil pH in this study differs greatly from the acid soils in southern Henan, explaining the inconsistency between the species of peanut rhizobia detected in southern Henan and the rest of the province. The symbiotic effect assay demonstrated that all representative strains successfully formed nodules and exhibited a significant increase in symbiotic efficiency. Representative strains revealed diverse abiotic stress tolerance to NaCl, acidity, alkalinity, temperature and drought. It conducted a comprehensive collection of peanut rhizobia in eastern, central, and northern Henan province, identifying two putative novelBradyrhizobiumspecies and isolating rhizobial strains with high symbiotic efficiency and robust stress tolerance.

Here, we demonstrate that a maternal gene <i>tudor</i> (<i>tud</i>) and its encoded protein have lower expression levels in ovaries of <i>Hamiltonella-</i>cured whiteflies.

Two dominant bacteria with no taxonomic classification beyond the class level (Paceibacteria) were discovered repeatedly in the most productive algal cultures. Long-read metagenomic sequencing was conducted to yield high-quality metagenomes, from which two novel species were discovered under the Seqcode (seqco.de/r:ywe1blo2), <i>Phycocordibacter aenigmaticus</i> gen. nov. sp. nov. and <i>Minusculum obligatum</i> gen. nov. sp. nov. The genus <i>Phycocordibacter</i> gen. nov. was proposed as the nomenclatural type of the family Phycocordibacteraceae fam. nov. and the order Phycocordibacterales ord. nov. Both bacteria possessed features typical of Patescibacteria such as reduced genomes (<800 kbp), lack of complete glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways, and inability to synthesize amino acids. Instead, they rely on the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (Calvin cycle) for essential biosynthesis and redox balance. <i>P. aenigmaticus</i> may also rely on elemental sulfur oxidation (<i>sdo</i>), partial nitrite reduction (<i>nirK</i>), and sulfur-related amino acid metabolism (SAMe  SAH). Both bacteria were found in high relative abundance in cultures of <i>Tetradesmus obliquus</i> HTB1 (freshwater) and <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> IMET1 (marine), suggesting a tight association with microalgae in various environments. The absence of full metabolic pathways for energy production suggests extreme metabolic limitations and obligate symbiosis, most likely with other bacteria associated with the microalgae.IMPORTANCETo our knowledge, this is the first report of Patescibacteria as dominant bacteria associated with microalgae or within a biologically mediated carbon capture system. Two novel Patescibacteria were found in two ecologically distinct microalgal cultures (one freshwater strain and one marine) regardless of whether the cultures were bubbled with air, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, or 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. This unexpected and unprecedented dominance led to long-read sequencing and the assembly of high-quality metagenomes for both Patescibacteria, as well as five other bacteria in the system.

This review focuses on the differences and similarities existing between extant endosymbionts and the two major endosymbiont derived organelles: the mitochondria and plastids. Emphasis is put on recent developments that point to the major role of intracellular pathogens in the establishment of these organelles. We argue that metabolic integration of bacterial endosymbionts into mitochondria and plastids required an unusually high degree of preadaptation not shared by most extant endosymbionts.

This colonization has been revealed to reduce aphid survival and reproductive potential. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects could provide insight into what occurs to aphids when they feed on endophytically colonized plants. In this study, an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted for transcriptome analyses of the melon aphid Aphis gossypii and its symbiotic bacteria after feeding on Beauveria bassiana endophytically colonized melon plants. The fungal colonization triggers significant alterations in the aphid transcriptome, reflecting molecular responses to fungal propagules and/or plant-induced systemic resistance. Key changes include the up-regulation of genes involved in host plant recognition by the aphid pest, immune system activation, energy production, and defense mechanisms such as toxin adaptation, detoxification, and cell death markers. Genes associated with escape responses, including alarm pheromone production and wing bud differentiation, were also up-regulated. In contrast, down-regulated genes point to disruptions in homeostasis and neuronal function, further impacting aphid physiology and its symbiotic relationship with Buchnera. These molecular perturbations likely underlie the lethal and sublethal effects observed in aphids feeding on B. bassiana-colonized plants.

Mites within the Uroobovella nova species complex have a narrow range of carriers limited to burying beetles.

This study investigated how carrier sex, body size, season, and year affect the relationship between U. nova and N. vespilloides. We tested the hypotheses that mite infestation is sex-biased because of differences in parental care between females and males and that larger individuals carry more mites. Mite prevalence was affected only by season. A slightly higher mite load was found in females than in males, and mites showed a significant but weak preference for beetle body size. Considerable temporal differences in mite load were found. Deutonymphs were highly specific when selecting attachment sites, irrespective of the carrier sex, and appeared on some body parts when the preferred sites had already been infested.

Four monophyletic families were recovered with strong support: Botryobasidiaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, Hydnaceae s.l., and Tulasnellaceae, with Hydnaceae containing the greatest species richness and morphological diversity. Our results suggest the Cantharellales diverged during the Carboniferous period with subsequent diversification following the Permian-Triassic extinction. Ancestral state reconstruction supports a saprotrophic most recent common ancestor with at least three transitions to an ectomycorrhizal ecology, multiple transitions to a lichenicolous habit with one or more subsequent transitions to mutualistic nutritional modes, four transitions to an orchid mycorrhizal ecology, and two transitions to a lichenized lifestyle. This study represents the first comprehensive examination of the evolution of form and function across this ecologically and morphologically diverse order of fungi.",40468534
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Marked Genome Reduction Driven by a Parasitic Lifestyle: Two Complete Genomes of Endosymbiotic Bacteria Possibly Hosted by a Dinoflagellate.,"Bacteria with endosymbiotic lifestyles often show marked genome reduction. While the shrinkage of genomes in intracellular symbionts of animals, including parasitic bacteria, has been extensively exami-ned, less is known about symbiotic bacteria associated with single-celled eukaryotes. We herein report the genomes of two novel gammaproteobacterial lineages, RS3 and XS4, identified as putative parasitic endosymbionts of the dinoflagellate Citharistes regius. Phylogenetic ana-lyses suggest that RS3 and XS4 belong to the family Fastidiosibacteraceae within the order Beggiatoales, forming independent lineages therein. The genomes of RS3 and XS4 are 529 and 436 kbp in size, respectively, revealing marked reductions from related bacterial genomes. XS4, which has a very reduced genome with a low GC content, uses a different genetic code, in which UGA assigned tryptophan. The small genomes of RS3 and XS4 encode a limited number of proteins, retaining only approximately 20% of the predicted ancestral proteome. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that RS3 and XS4 are parasitic symbionts that are heavily dependent on their host for essential metabolites. Furthermore, we found that the ancestor of both genomes likely acquired an ADP:ATP antiporter gene via horizontal gene transfer, an event that may have enabled their evolution as energy parasites by facilitating the acquisition of ATP from their host. These results on novel bacteria with highly reduced genomes expand our understanding of the phylogenetic and genomic diversities of endosymbiotic bacteria in protists.",40467487
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",A Biosynthetic and Taxonomic Atlas of the Global Lichen Holobiont.,"Lichens are pioneer species in several ecosystems, and as such are found in a variety of geographic regions and environments. Here, inspection of metagenomic data from 794 lichen samples from 34 countries reveals the presence of a complex holobiont harbouring remarkable biosynthetic capabilities, particularly in the bacterial consortia, a component that has been somewhat underappreciated. While bacteria were consistently present, their abundance varied among lichen taxa. Common bacterial genera included Microbacterium, Terribacillus, and JABEUN01 (an Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium awaiting Latin binomial naming assignment) albeit in low abundance. Lichenihabitans and Sphingomonas genera were moderately abundant, present in approximately 30% of samples, and exhibited an enrichment in the number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted to encode secondary metabolites (biosynthetic potential). We found that both fungal and bacterial biosynthetic repertoires appeared to follow genus-specific patterns but that there was greater relative homogeneity of BGCs in the fungal genera. The substantial biosynthetic diversity within lichen holobionts is evident in our findings, with the lichen-associated bacteria emerging as a promising potential source for sustainable drug discovery.",40467297
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Transcriptomic analysis reveals genetic factors underlying impaired symbiotic nitrogen fixation in lines derived from crosses between cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and its wild ancestors.,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is a complex process regulated by numerous genes extensively studied in legumes that undergo intracellular infection, such as Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and Glycine max. However, the molecular and genetic mechanisms of SNF in legumes that rely on the intercellular infection pathway, such as peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), remain poorly understood. In a previous study, we identified two chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), 12CS_051 and 12CS_044, each contains a wild segment on homeologous regions of chromosomes A02 and B02 respectively, that are severely impaired in nitrogen fixation. In this study, we have compared the transcriptomes of those lines with that of their recurrent parent, Fleur11, in roots inoculated with the effective Bradyrhizobium vignae strain ISRA400 to identify candidate genes associated with the reduced nitrogen fixation observed in these CSSLs. A comparative analysis of the transcriptome profiles of the CSSLs and Fleur11 revealed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in plant immune signaling and key symbiotic genes, such as NIN, EFD, FEN1 or SNF-related transporters. These results align with the phenotypic differences observed during the symbiotic process in the CSSLs. When focusing on each QTL region, we found that only the orthologs of the symbiotic gene FEN1, which is responsible for the failure in the enlargement of infected cells in L. japonicus, exhibited a lack of expression in the two CSSLs compared to Fleur11. FEN1 encodes a homocitrate synthase that is essential for the nitrogenase activity. We hypothesize that changes in the expression of FEN1 could affect the nitrogenase activity, potentially leading to the unfair SNF observed in these lines. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of two ineffective nitrogen-fixing chromosome segment substitution lines and identified FEN1 as a suitable candidate gene involved in peanut symbiosis. This research provides valuable insights into understanding and improving SNF in peanut.",40461988

Here, we investigated the metatranscriptome of two Ca. Altiarchaeum populations that thrive in two substantially different subsurface ecosystems. In Crystal Geyser, a high-CO<sub>2</sub> groundwater system in the USA, Ca. Altiarchaeum crystalense co-occurs with the symbiont Ca. Huberiarchaeum crystalense, while in the Muehlbacher sulfidic spring in Germany, an artesian spring high in sulfide concentration, Ca. A. hamiconexum is heavily infected with viruses. We here mapped metatranscriptome reads against their genomes to analyse the insitu expression profile of their core genomes. Out of 537 shared gene clusters, 331 were functionally annotated and 130 differed significantly in expression between the two sites. Main differences were related to genes involved in cell defence like CRISPR-Cas, virus defence, replication, transcription and energy and carbon metabolism. Our results demonstrate that altiarchaeal populations in the subsurface are likely adapted to their environment while influenced by other biological entities that tamper with their core metabolism. We consequently posit that viruses and symbiotic interactions can be major energy sinks for organisms in the deep biosphere.",40461259
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Metagenome-based microbial metabolic strategies to mitigate ruminal methane emissions using Komagataeibacter-based symbiotics.,"Global warming increasingly threatens organisms in equatorial regions, where temperatures often exceed physiological limits. Rumen methanogens are a major biological source of anthropogenic methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Therefore, ruminal methane mitigation strategies that preserve animal productivity are urgently needed. Our In vitro analysis of Holstein steer rumen fluid-integrating gas production, volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles, and metagenomic data-demonstrated that kombucha, a fermented beverage, effectively reduces methane emissions by modulating ruminal fermentation. Rumen fluid was incubated for 60h under three treatments (control, 3-NOP, and kombucha). During the initial 30h, kombucha reduced methane by 15.07% compared to the control but was 17.54% higher than 3-NOP. In the subsequent 30h, kombucha achieved sustained reductions of 34.72% versus the control and 26.28% versus 3-NOP, highlighting its uniquely sustained methane-reducing effect. A metagenomics-guided screening and in vitro validation identified Komagataeibacter intermedius SLAM-NK6B as a key strain underlying the methane-reducing effect of kombucha. The genome of SLAM-NK6B encodes biosynthetic gene clusters for cellulose, malate, citrate, and methanobactin-metabolites that can modulate the rumen microbiota. SLAM-NK6B supplementation reduced methanogen abundance by 53.32% and increased hydrogen pressure, shifting microbial metabolism. Excluding acetate, VFA production increased significantly, with propionate levels elevated by 15.39-43.81%. Metagenomic data further indicated activation of alternative hydrogen sink pathways, including citrate-to-propionate and malate-to-propionate conversions. This study proposes a novel microbial metabolic strategy for methane mitigation, enabling both methane reduction and enhanced fermentation efficiency. Such metabolic guidance of the rumen microbiome offers a sustainable approach to low-emission ruminant production.",40460541
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",The insight into the biology of five homologous lectins produced by the entomopathogenic bacterium and nematode symbiont Photorhabdus laumondii.,"Photorhabdus laumondii is a well-known bacterium with a complex life cycle involving mutualism with nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis and pathogenicity towards insect hosts. It provides an excellent model for studying the diverse roles of lectins, saccharide-binding proteins, in both symbiosis and pathogenicity. This study focuses on the seven-bladed -propeller lectins of P. laumondii (PLLs), examining their biochemical properties (structure and saccharide specificity) and biological functions (gene expression, interactions with the nematode symbiont, and the host immune system response). Structural analyses revealed diverse oligomeric states among PLLs and a unique organisation of binding sites not described outside the PLL lectin family. Lectins exhibited high specificity for fucosylated and O-methylated saccharides with a significant avidity effect for multivalent ligands. Gene expression analysis across bacterial growth phases revealed that PLLs are predominantly expressed during the exponential phase. Interaction studies with the host immune system demonstrated that PLL5 uniquely induced melanisation in Galleria mellonella hemolymph. Furthermore, PLL2, PLL3, and PLL5 interfered with reactive oxygen species production in human blood cells, indicating their potential role in modulating host immune responses. Biofilm formation assays and binding studies with nematode life stages showed no significant involvement of PLLs in nematode colonization. Our findings highlight the primary role of PLLs in Photorhabdus pathogenicity rather than in symbiosis and offer valuable insight into the fascinating dynamics within the Photorhabdus-nematode-insect triparted system.",40459235

The absorption of potassium by Plant is mediated by potassium channels and transporters, and the Shaker potassium channel gene family plays an important role in potassium uptake. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form ubiquitous symbioses with plants and increase plants' potassium uptake. However, few studies have focused on the interaction of plant potassium channels from the Shaker gene family with AM fungi. In this study, the potassium uptake function of LbKT1 and LbSKOR (homologs of AKT1 and SKOR in Arabidopsis) from the Shaker gene family in Lycium barbarum was verified by the complementary assay using a yeast potassium uptake mutant. LbKT1 and LbSKOR were also overexpressed in tobacco to assess their influence on AM fungi under low and normal potassium conditions in a pot experiment. LbKT1 could rescue the phenotype of the yeast mutant, while LbSKOR could not. Overexpression of LbKT1 increased tobacco plant growth and potassium uptake and promoted the colonization of AM fungi. Meanwhile, overexpression of LbSKOR promoted potassium translocation from root to shoot and showed no obvious influence on the colonization of AM fungi. Our results suggested that the AM fungi could promote tobacco growth and potassium uptake, while the plant potassium status and the AM fungal colonization may form positive feedback in promoting tobacco potassium uptake and growth.",40456416
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary history and association with seaweeds shape the genomes and metabolisms of marine bacteria.,"Seaweeds harbor a rich diversity of bacteria, providing them with metabolic resources and a surface for attachment and biofilm development. The host's unique environment potentially shapes the bacterial genomes and promotes adaptations for a symbiotic lifestyle. To investigate whether the genomes of seaweed-associated bacteria are genetically and metabolically distinct from their close free-living relatives in seawater, we compared both the seaweed-associated and free-living counterparts of 72 bacterial genera across 16 seaweed hosts using whole-genome sequences or high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes. While taxonomic affiliation strongly influenced genome characteristics such as GC content, gene number, and size, host association had a lower effect overall. A reduced genome size was suggested only in <i>Nereocystis luetkeana</i>-associated microbes, while only <i>Ascophyllum nodosum</i>-associated bacteria had an increased GC content. Metabolic adaptations were indicated from the genomes of seaweed-associated bacteria, including enriched pathways for B vitamin production, complex carbohydrate utilization, and amino acid biosynthesis. In particular, <i>Flavobacteriia</i> showed the most pronounced differences between host-associated and free-living strains. We further hypothesized that bacteria associated with seaweed might have evolved to complement their host's metabolism and tested this inference by analyzing the genomes of both the seaweed <i>Ectocarpus subulatus</i> and its 28 bacterial associates but found no evidence for such complementarity. Our analyses of 72 paired bacterial genomes highlighted significant metabolic differences in seaweed-associated strains with implications for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in the coastal ocean. We hypothesized that the unique environment of seaweeds in coastal oceans shapes bacterial genomes and promotes a symbiotic lifestyle. We compared the genomes of bacteria isolated from seaweed with bacteria from the same genus found free-living in seawater. For genome features that included the number of genes, the size of the genome, and the GC content, taxonomy was of greater importance than bacterial lifestyle. When we compared metabolic abilities, we again found a strong effect of taxonomy in determining metabolism. Although several metabolic pathways differed between free-living and host-associated bacteria, this was especially prominent for <i>Flavobacteriia</i> in the phylum <i>Bacteroidota</i>. Notably, bacteria living on seaweeds had an increased occurrence of genes for B vitamin synthesis, complex carbohydrate use, and nitrogen uptake, indicating that bacterial genomes reflect both their evolutionary history and the current environment they inhabit.",40454874

"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Exploring the influence of symbiosis between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and beans on potassium uptake and the activity of AKT and HKT genes.,"In plants, potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) serves multiple functions, despite being scarce due to strong soil adsorption. This study examined how the presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) like Rhizophagus irregularis and Funneliformis mosseae influenced the absorption and transport of K<sup>+</sup> in bean roots through symbiotic interactions. In a symbiotic relationship, AMF had the potential to enhance potassium absorption and storage in various tissues of bean seedlings. Under symbiotic conditions, the concentration of potassium in stem tissues was observed to increase almost four times more than control conditions. The genome of beans was shown to contain a total of nineteen PvAKT genes and two PvHKT genes. Based on phylogeny analysis, PvAKT family members and their corresponding orthologs were categorized into four distinct groups. Subfamily 3 of the PvAKT phylogeny tree exhibited distinct variations from other subfamilies in terms of gene structure, conserved domains, and potential phosphorylation sites. The presence of cis-regulatory element related to ABA responsiveness in the upstream region led to the division of PvAKT and PvHKT genes into two specific groups. Gene expression analysis disclosed that PvAKT and PvHKT genes are induced by AMF and have tissue specific expression. PvAKT6 and PvAKT11 genes and both PvHKT genes showed differential expression in root and shoot tissues, while PvAKT3 gene increased expression in both root and shoot tissues. The results suggest that AMF had a significant impact on increasing the solubility of K<sup>+</sup> and ultimately enhancing the function of K<sup>+</sup> transporters.",40450130
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Sex Ratio Distortion Mediated by Cytoplasmic Symbionts.,"Endosymbionts are widespread in animals, and they have deeply shaped their hosts' evolution and ecology. As they are usually maternally inherited from one host generation to the next, a diverse array of endosymbionts (including bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and viruses) have evolved strategies to distort host sex ratios toward females in arthropods, via male killing, parthenogenesis induction, and feminization. Seminal discoveries made in the past few years have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of sex ratio distortion in various host-symbiont systems. Emerging trends suggest that (i) a single symbiont gene is generally sufficient to mediate sex ratio distortion in a given system; (ii) causal genes are often associated with mobile elements, including prophages and plasmids; (iii) causal genes are evolutionarily diverse between systems, although they may exhibit homologous domains; and (iv) host sex-specific molecular pathways, such as sex determination and dosage compensation, are preferential targets of cytoplasmic symbiont factors. It appears that the various reproductive manipulations have evolved multiple times independently, suggesting that the recently elucidated host-symbiont systems only represent the tip of the iceberg of the high diversity of sex ratio distortion mechanisms. Capturing the breadth of these mechanisms is a desirable and arguably reachable goal that will not only lead to a better understanding of host-symbiont molecular interactions but also has the potential to yield unprecedented insights into the molecular cascades underlying host sex determination and sexual differentiation.",40448476
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",T7 RNA polymerase-based gene expression from a transcriptionally silent rDNA spacer in the endosymbiont-harboring trypanosomatid Angomonas deanei.,"Eukaryotic life has been shaped fundamentally by the integration of bacterial endosymbionts. The trypanosomatid Angomonas deanei that contains a -proteobacterial endosymbiont, represents an emerging model to elucidate initial steps in symbiont integration. Although the repertoire of genetic tools for A. deanei is growing, no conditional gene expression system is available yet, which would be key for the functional characterization of essential or expression of toxic proteins. Development of a conditional expression system based on endogenous RNA polymerase II (POLII) is hampered by the absence of information on transcription signals in A. deanei as well as the unusual genetic system used in the Trypanosomatidae that relies on read-through transcription. This mode of transcription can result in polar effects when manipulating expression of genes in their endogenous loci. Finally, only a few resistance markers are available for A. deanei yet, restricting the number of genetic modifications that can be introduced into one strain. To increase the range of possible genetic manipulations in A. deanei, and in particular, build the base for a conditional expression system that does not interfere with the endogenous gene expression machinery, here we (i) implemented two new drug resistance markers, (ii) identified the spacer upstream of the rDNA array on chromosome 13 as transcriptionally silent genomic locus, and (iii) used this locus for engineering an ectopic expression system that depends on the T7 RNA polymerase expressed from the -amastin locus. We show that transgene expression in this system is independent of the activity of endogenous RNA polymerases, reaches expression levels similar to the previously described POLII-dependent expression from the -amastin locus, and can be applied for studying endosymbiosis. In sum, the new tools expand the possibilities for genetic manipulations of A. deanei and provide a solid base for the development of an ectopic conditional expression system.",40446003
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Accelerated Pseudogenization in the Ancient Endosymbionts of Giant Scale Insects.,"Symbiotic microorganisms are subject to a complex interplay of environmental and population-genetic pressures that drive their gene loss. Despite the widely held perception that ancient symbionts have stable genomes, even tiny genomes experience ongoing pseudogenization. Whether these tiny genomes also experience bursts of rapid gene loss is, however, less understood. Giant scale insects (Monophlebidae) feed on plant sap and rely on the symbiotic bacterium Walczuchella, which provides them with essential nutrients. When compared with other ancient symbionts with similar genome sizes, such as Karelsulcia, Walczuchella's genome was previously reported as unusually pseudogene-rich (10% of coding sequences). However, this result was based on only one genome assembly, raising questions about the assembly quality or a recent ecological shift such as co-symbiont acquisition driving the gene loss. Here, we generated six complete genomes of Walczuchella from three genera of giant scales, each with distinct co-symbiotic partners. We show that all the genomes are highly degraded, and particularly genes related to the cellular envelope and energy metabolism seem to be undergoing pseudogenization. Apart from general mechanisms driving genome reduction, such as the long-term intracellular lifestyle with transmission bottlenecks, we hypothesize that a more profound loss of DNA replication and repair genes, together with recent co-obligate symbiont acquisitions, likely contribute to the accelerated degradation of Walczuchella genomes. Our results highlight that even ancient symbionts with small genomes can experience significant bursts of gene loss when stochastic processes erase a gene that accelerates gene loss or when the selection pressure changes such as after co-symbiont acquisition.",40442955
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Shifts and critical periods in coral metabolism reveal energetic vulnerability during development.,"Climate change accelerates coral reef decline and jeopardizes recruitment essential for ecosystem recovery. Adult corals rely on a vital nutritional exchange with their symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae), but the dynamics of reliance from fertilization to recruitment are understudied. We investigated the physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic changes across 13 developmental stages of Montipora capitata, a coral in Hawai'i that inherits symbionts from parent to egg. We found that embryonic development depends on maternally provisioned mRNAs and lipids, with a rapid shift to symbiont-derived nutrition in late developmental stages. Symbiont density and photosynthesis peak in swimming larvae to fuel pelagic dispersal. By contrast, respiratory demand increases significantly during metamorphosis and settlement, reflecting this energy-intensive morphological reorganization. Symbiont proliferation is driven by symbiont ammonium assimilation in larval stages with little evidence of nitrogen metabolism in the coral host. As development progresses, the host enhances nitrogen sequestration, regulating symbiont populations, and ensuring the transfer of fixed carbon to support metamorphosis, with both metabolomic and transcriptomic indicators of increased carbohydrate availability. Although algal symbiont community composition remained stable, bacterial communities shifted with ontogeny, associated with holobiont metabolic reorganization. Our study reveals extensive metabolic changes during development with increasing reliance on symbiont nutrition. Metamorphosis and settlement emerge as critical periods of energetic vulnerability to projected climate scenarios that destabilize symbiosis. This highly detailed characterization of symbiotic nutritional exchange during sensitive early life stages provides essential knowledge for understanding and forecasting the function of nutritional symbioses and, specifically, coral survival and recruitment in a future of climate change.",40441134
"""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","Decoding fungal communication networks: molecular signaling, genetic regulation, and ecological implications.","Fungal communication networks regulate essential biological processes, enabling fungi to adapt to environmental changes, coordinate development, and establish interactions within microbial communities. These networks are mediated by diverse signaling molecules, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), peptide signaling molecules, and quorum-sensing molecules, which facilitate intra- and interspecies communication. The intricate regulation of these signals occurs through specialized signal transduction pathways such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and two-component regulatory systems, allowing fungi to sense external cues and modulate their physiological responses. Genetic mechanisms also play a critical role in fungal communication, influencing community dynamics through regulatory genes governing hyphal fusion, pheromone signaling, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Crosstalk between these signaling pathways is further modulated by epigenetic modifications, which fine-tune gene expression in response to environmental conditions. The integration of these molecular networks shapes fungal interactions, impacting resource acquisition, symbiosis, and pathogenicity. Additionally, fungal communication has significant ecological and evolutionary implications, contributing to niche establishment, microbial competition, and host-pathogen interactions. Despite significant progress in understanding fungal communication, key knowledge gaps remain regarding the interplay between signaling molecules, genetic regulation, and environmental adaptation. Future research should focus on unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying fungal signaling networks and their potential applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine.

Since the phylloxera crisis, cultivated grapevines are obtained by grafting a Vitis vinifera scion onto a rootstock. In this study, we investigated the responses of the rootstock ""Riparia Gloire de Montpellier"" to mycorrhizal root colonization under three distinct phosphate (P) levels. We explored regulatory aspects of plant P nutrition by comparing the transcriptome profiling of non-colonized roots and roots colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198. We have shown that P availability significantly influences gene expression in both the AM fungus and the grapevine. Our transcriptomic study shed light on the molecular mechanisms that prevail during the AM symbiosis of a perennial woody plant species, with available P affecting several functional classes of proteins. The nine genes coding for Pht1 transporters in the R. irregularis genome were either down-regulated (RiPT1 and RiPT2) or up-regulated by the high-P treatment (RiPT8 and RiPT11), up-regulated by the low-P treatment (RiPT5), and regulated in a P-dose-dependent manner (RiPT9 and RiPT10). Expression of two of the three identified AM-induced Pht1, VvPT4 and VvPT8, was enhanced under mycorrhizal conditions, but finely tuned by the P treatment. To immunolocalize VvPT4 and VvPT8, we developed an innovative root-clearing protocol specifically designed for woody plants.

Constructing synthetic microbial consortia based on cross-feeding is a promising strategy for bioremediation and bioproduction. But how to improve the performance and the stability of consortia remains a challenge. This review discusses the features of two opposite evolutionary directions of cross-feeding consortia over time, providing insights into the factors affecting the evolutionary process. While coevolving, cross-feeding may strengthen with stronger metabolic coupling, deeper growth dependence, and/or deeper evolutionary dependence; then the consortia become reinforced. Conversely, unsuitable environmental conditions can lead to the direct collapse of the cross-feeding consortia due to metabolic decoupling, partner extinction, or cheater dominance. The loss of the fitness advantage and the constraints on the evolutionary ability can also lead to the weakening of cross-feeding.

Endosymbionts are in host specialised cells, called the bacteriocytes, which in many insects group together to form a symbiotic organ, the bacteriome. The cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae houses multiple bacteriomes at the adult mesenteric caeca. Using microscopic cell imaging, we revealed that bacteriomes consist of several cell types, including progenitor cells, peripheral bacteriocytes, central bacteriocytes and epithelial cells. By combining laser capture microdissection and dual RNA-sequencing, we showed that both host cell types and their associated endosymbionts express distinct transcriptional profiles. The comparison between peripheral bacteriocytes and midgut cells from insects artificially deprived from endosymbionts (aposymbiotic) unravelled cellular pathways modulated by the presence of endosymbionts. The cell-specific response to endosymbionts in peripheral bacteriocytes includes a boost of fatty-acid and amino acid metabolisms. We found that central bacteriocytes overexpress transport and G-protein signalling-related genes when compared to peripheral bacteriocytes, indicating a signalling and/or transport function of these cells. Diet composition strongly impacts host and endosymbiont gene expression and reveals a molecular trade-off among metabolic pathways. This study provides evidence on how endosymbionts interfere and enhance metabolic performances of insect bacteriocytes and highlights key genes involved in the bacteriocyte differentiation and metabolic pathways.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Mobile gene clusters and coexpressed plant-rhizobium pathways drive partner quality variation in symbiosis.,"Plant-microbe symbioses such as the legume-rhizobium mutualism are vital in the web of ecological relationships within both natural and managed ecosystems, influencing primary productivity, crop yield, and ecosystem services. The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence-absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules. Functionally our results point to management of oxidative stress, amino acid and carbohydrate transport, and NCR peptide signaling mechanisms in driving symbiotic outcomes. Our integrative approach highlights the complex genetic architecture of microbial partner quality and raises hypotheses about the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis.",40729388
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Adaptive pangenomic remodeling in the Azolla cyanobiont amid a transient microbiome.,"Plants fix nitrogen in concert with diverse microbial symbionts, often recruiting them from the surrounding environment each generation. Vertical transmission of a microbial symbiont from parent to offspring can produce extreme evolutionary consequences, including metabolic codependence, genome reduction, and synchronized life cycles. One of the few examples of vertical transmission of N-fixing symbionts occurs in Azolla ferns, which maintain an obligate mutualism with the cyanobacterium Trichormus azollae-but the genomic consequences of this interaction, and whether the symbiosis involves other vertically transmitted microbial partners, are currently unknown. We generated high-coverage metagenomes across the genus Azolla and reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes to investigate whether a core microbiome exists within Azolla leaf cavities, and how the genomes of T. azollae diverged from their free-living relatives. Our results suggest that T. azollae is the only consistent symbiont across all Azolla accessions, and that other bacterial groups are transient or facultative associates. Pangenomic analyses of T. azollae indicate extreme pseudogenization and gene loss compared to free-living relatives-especially in defensive, stress-tolerance, and secondary metabolite pathways-yet, the key functions of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis remain intact. Additionally, differential codon bias and intensified positive selection on photosynthesis, intracellular transport, and carbohydrate metabolism genes suggest ongoing evolution in response to the unique conditions within Azolla leaf cavities. These findings highlight how genome erosion and shifting selection pressures jointly drive the evolution of this unique mutualism, while broadening the taxonomic scope of genomic studies on vertically transmitted symbioses.",40728316

As the supplementary receptors to odorant receptors (ORs) and gustatory receptors (GRs) in insects, we compare the evolutionary characters of ionotropic receptors (IRs) among 25 fig wasp taxa in six genera. In total, we identified 205 IRs in 25 fig wasps, with each taxon recording from 5 to 12 IR genes. We found 189 IR genes clustered into 18 orthologous groups that can be divided into three types: IRco, antennal IRs, and divergent IRs. More IRs belong to antennal IRs in fig wasps, which can be sensitive to acids, aldehydes, polyamines, salt, amino acids, and temperature/humidity according to homology comparison. Additionally, some IR genes in fig wasps do not cluster with those of outgroup species (e.g., <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Apis mellifera</i>), suggesting they may represent a unique group and may have special functions in fig wasps. Divergent IRs are very few, with large sequence variation between species. Compared to ORs and GRs in fig wasps, gene sequences in most IR orthologous groups are more conserved between genera, with the lowest sequence similarity in 10 orthologous groups (including three IRco) exhibiting above 58.5%. Gene sequences are consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among fig wasps, which is the same as ORs and GRs. Strong purifying selection of IR genes was detected, as shown by the low  values. Signatures of positive selection were detected in loci from three orthologous groups. Our results provide important molecular information for further studies on chemosensory mechanisms in fig wasps.",40725310
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Drying-rewetting legacy mitigates freezing-thawing effects on soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas emissions in plateau riparian wetlands.,"Climate change intensifies compound disturbances in soil ecosystems, yet how legacy effects from prior events shape microbial responses to subsequent stresses remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the legacy effects of drying-rewetting (DW) and freeze-thaw (FT) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and microbial community dynamics across riparian wetlands of the Tibetan Plateau with distinct land-use histories (urban, grazing, and natural). The results showed that urban soils consistently amplified CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to grazing and natural lands, whereas natural soils exhibited a pronounced decline in fungal ITS gene abundance, contrasting with the resilience observed in urban and grazing counterparts. Notably, sequential DW-FT perturbations triggered cross-stress mitigation, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and enriching Actinobacteria-a bacterial phylum negatively correlated with cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> release. Concurrently, DW legacies drove the taxonomic restructuring of fungal communities, favoring the dominance of Ascomycota in natural soils subjected to subsequent FT cycles. Prior DW exposure uniquely amplified the relative abundance of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) under FT fluctuations, while standalone FT legacies lacked comparable regulatory capacity. Furthermore, in bacterial co-occurrence networks exposed to two DW cycles, an incomplete cluster emerged, indicating short-term adaptation via compartmentalization. Fungal clusters under FT cycles exhibited simplified co-response patterns but activated mutualism. Our study demonstrates that DW/FT legacy effects on GHG emissions and microbial communities are land-use dependent; DW legacies mitigate FT-induced microbiome disruptions in plateau riparian soils, with fungi showing heightened sensitivity to FT and bacteria displaying adaptability to DW, highlighting taxon-specific responses to compound disturbances.",40602634
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Microbial cross-feeding stabilized by segregation of a dependent mutant from its independent ancestor.,"Microbial gene loss is hypothesized to be beneficial when gene function is costly, and the gene product can be replaced via cross-feeding from a neighbor. However, cross-fed metabolites are often only available at low concentrations, limiting the growth rates of gene-loss mutants that are dependent on those metabolites. Here we define conditions that support a loss of function mutant in a three-member bacterial community of (i) N2-utilizing Rhodopseudomonas palustris as an NH4+-excreting producer, (ii) N2-utilizing Vibrio natriegens as the ancestor, and (iii) a V. natriegens N2-utilizaton mutant that is dependent on the producer for NH4+. Using experimental and simulated cocultures, we found that the ancestor outcompeted the mutant due to low NH4+ availability under uniform conditions where both V. natriegens strains had equal access to nutrients. However, spatial structuring that increasingly segregated the mutant from the ancestor, while maintaining access to NH4+ from the producer, allowed the mutant to avoid extinction. Counter to predictions, mutant enrichment under spatially structured conditions did not require a growth rate advantage from gene loss and the mutant coexisted with its ancestor. Thus, cross-feeding can originate from loss-of-function mutations that are otherwise detrimental, provided that the mutant can segregate from a competitive ancestor.",40568968
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",An endosymbiotic origin of the crimson pigment from the lac insect.,"Symbioses with microorganisms expand the genetic and metabolic repertoire of many insects. The lac insect <i>Kerria lacca</i> (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) is a phloem-feeding scale insect that is brightly colored due to the presence of natural polyhydroxy-anthraquinone pigments called laccaic acids. The deep red pigments possibly provide defense against pathogens and predators and are commercially important as dyes in textiles, lacquerware, and cosmetics. Laccaic acids are categorized as polyketides comprising an anthraquinone backbone decorated with tyrosine or its derivatives. However, the genetic basis of these pigments remains unknown, as insects are not known to produce aromatic polyketides or tyrosine de novo. Here, we sequence the genome of the lac insect and its two endosymbionts-<i>Wolbachia</i> and a hitherto unidentified, transovarially transmitted yeast-like symbiont (YLS). We found no evidence for the host or <i>Wolbachia</i> to be able to synthesize the pigments. The pigments and their precursors were also not detected in the host plant. Genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses combined with fluorescence microscopy identified and characterized YLS as the sole producer of the pigment's polyketide backbone and tyrosine moiety, demonstrating an endosymbiotic origin of the lac pigments. A nonreducing polyketide synthase gene cluster encoding the laccaic acid backbone was identified. Furthermore, the YLS genome encoded essential amino acids and vitamins that are deficient in the insect's phloem diet. Experimental fungicide-treated insects exhibited reduced concentrations of laccaic acids and tyrosine, along with decreased body size and weight, indicating a mutualistic association between the lac insect and its YLS.",40523179

Plant-fungal symbiosis is one of the most significant biotic interactions in the biosphere. The symbiotic association of fungi not only improves plant growth and resistance but has potential significance for endangered species conservation and reproduction. Alternative splicing is involved in regulating symbiotic responses to host immune signals, regulating the host-symbiont contact, and initiating signaling during symbiosis. In recent years, mRNAs research has been progressing rapidly, and AS is an important post-transcriptional regulator that requires further investigation. However, while AS has been widely studied in mammalian disease research, very limited studies are available on the regulation of AS in plant-fungal symbiosis and their role in benefiting the interacting partners.

Here it was characterised the bacterial microbiota associated with an Epichlo fungal endophyte (strain AR135) isolated from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) via both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and direct microbial isolation and investigated the microbe-microbe interactions between these bacteria and the fungus. The bacterial microbiota of AR135 was dominated by members within the genus Paenibacillus, with 99% of abundance (on average); although bacteria within genera Delftia and Bradyrhizobium were also present. Paenibacillus cells were located on the surface of hyphae of AR135 fungus invitro on synthetic media and in planta within perennial ryegrass leaves. Two bacterial strains, E100 and E300, identified as Paenibacillus, were isolated from the AR135 mycelium. E300 drastically altered the abundance of both the whole bacterial microbiota (increased by 63%) and E100 (reduced to 0%). None of the variations observed in the abundance of total bacterial microbiota and E100 and E300 were associated with changes in the fungal biomass of Epichlo.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""","Plants, Pollinators and Pheromones: Promises and Lies of Semiochemicals.","Pollination is traditionally regarded as a quintessential mutualism, yet many plants employ deceptive strategies to achieve reproductive success. Among the most intriguing is sexual deception, wherein flowers mimic the sex pheromones and visual signals of female insects to attract male pollinators-without providing any reward. This strategy, most notably observed in orchids, is a powerful driver of diversification and speciation. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and high-resolution imaging are shedding light on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms underpinning these complex mimicry systems. Remarkably, subtle genetic modifications and the repurposing of existing gene networks can give rise to highly specialized and effective forms of deception. Central to this process are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serve as species-specific semiochemicals that manipulate innate pollinator behaviors and reinforce reproductive isolation.

It provides an excellent model for studying the diverse roles of lectins, saccharide-binding proteins, in both symbiosis and pathogenicity. This study focuses on the seven-bladed -propeller lectins of P. laumondii (PLLs), examining their biochemical properties (structure and saccharide specificity) and biological functions (gene expression, interactions with the nematode symbiont, and the host immune system response). Structural analyses revealed diverse oligomeric states among PLLs and a unique organisation of binding sites not described outside the PLL lectin family. Lectins exhibited high specificity for fucosylated and O-methylated saccharides with a significant avidity effect for multivalent ligands. Gene expression analysis across bacterial growth phases revealed that PLLs are predominantly expressed during the exponential phase. Interaction studies with the host immune system demonstrated that PLL5 uniquely induced melanisation in Galleria mellonella hemolymph. Furthermore, PLL2, PLL3, and PLL5 interfered with reactive oxygen species production in human blood cells, indicating their potential role in modulating host immune responses. Biofilm formation assays and binding studies with nematode life stages showed no significant involvement of PLLs in nematode colonization.

Although mammalian cell fusion is mechanistically dissected, the mechanism for such microbial-cell fusions is unknown. To start exploring this mechanism, we used RNA sequencing to identify genes differentially expressed in this coculture using two types of comparisons. One type compared coculture to the two monocultures, capturing the combined impact of interactions through soluble signals in the medium and through direct cell-to-cell interactions. The second type compared membrane-separated versus -unseparated cocultures, isolating the impact of interspecies physical contact. While we could not firmly identify specific genes that might drive cell fusion, consistent with our hypothesized model for this interspecies microbial cell fusion, we observed differential regulation of genes involved in <i>C. ljungdahlii's</i> autotrophic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway metabolism and genes of the motility machinery. Unexpectedly, we also identified differential regulation of biosynthetic genes of several amino acids, and notably of arginine and histidine. We verified that they are produced by <i>C. acetobutylicum</i> and are metabolized by <i>C. ljungdahlii</i> to its growth advantage.

While most research on their microbiota has focused on fungal associates, their bacterial communities remain largely understudied. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on the bacterial microbiota of ambrosia beetles, identify critical gaps in the field, and provide recommendations for future research. To date, eight metabarcoding studies have explored bacterial communities in ambrosia beetles, analyzing a total of 13 species, mostly within the tribe Xyleborini (Scolytinae). These studies have examined the presence of bacteria in ambrosia beetle mycetangia, organs specialized for transporting fungal symbionts, as well as bacterial diversity in fungal gardens and whole beetles, across different life stages, and under varying environmental conditions. In general, bacterial communities appear to be highly specific to the beetle species, and differ between the beetles and their fungal gardens. Most studies employed 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, and the optimal primer combination for characterizing bacterial communities in environmental samples is 515F/806RB (V4). Various methods for collecting beetles have been used, such as ethanol-baited traps, direct collection from galleries, logs kept in emergence cages, and rearing, but which of them to select when planning a study depends on the specific aim. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding the functional roles of dominant bacterial taxa, as metabarcoding studies often assume that these roles are similar to those played in other beetle species, such as bark beetles.

IR imaging preliminarily identified the primary thermogenic tissues of the receptacle as the carpels and epidermis. The calcium distribution visualized by -XRF complemented the results of IR imaging, indicating that the thermogenic tissues include the epidermis and the upper parts of the carpels. This ensures that heat reaches the chamber formed by the petals and receptacle over the shortest distance, thereby minimizing heat loss. Additionally, we observed a higher rate of Ca2+ transport from the apoplast to the cytosol and upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial calcium uniporters (MCU) at the thermogenesis initiation stage as compared to the prethermogenic stage. Increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ (cCa2+) concentration reversed the inhibition of alternative respiratory pathways, further illustrating the close relationship between Ca2+ concentration and thermogenesis.

Symbioses with these microeukaryotes have independently evolved multiple times, and non-coral cnidarians (e.g., sea anemones) serve as a valuable and insightful comparative system due to their ease of husbandry in the laboratory and their ability to shuffle different strains of their photosymbionts to acclimate to thermal conditions. This breadth of symbiont shuffling is exemplified by the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima , which naturally occurs in symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Breviolum muscatinei (formerly Symbiodinium) or the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina as well as being aposymbiotic. Here, we assembled a draft genome and used multi-omics to characterise multiple physiological levels of each phenotype.

We aimed i) to explore the microbial alteration driven by endophytic Acrocalymma vagum in developing crop yield and rice resistance; ii) to reveal the mechanism of root-released compound stimulated by A. vagum in recruiting benefit microbes. The microbiome was applied in a culture-dependent and culture-independent method to study the microbial communities of the A. vagum-rice holobiont using 16S rRNA and ITS gene metabarcoding. Non-target metabolome identified distinct metabolites responsible for community variations. Label-free proteomic analyses investigated the association between primary genes related to the holobiont formation. CRISPR/Cas9 technique and homologous recombination replacement were used to characterize the functions of putative genes. A. vagum enhanced cultivated rice yield by 5.731.76% and induced 83.249.86% control efficiency against rice blast. We discovered that A. vagum simplified rice microbial structure based on co-occurrence networks, by lowering the proportion of potentially pathogenic predominant Burkholderia and driving rice to recruit beneficial Lactobacillus, Sarocladium and Nigrospora to promote rice growth with the increases of 44.415.10% shoot height and 70.219.57% shoot biomass. Moreover, the holobiont released coumaric and trans-ferulic acids to attract beneficial microbes. 206 rice proteins were notably up-regulated in the holobiont, particularly the OsPrxs. CRISPR/Cas9-edited mutants of OsPRX70 and OsPRX95 reduced the promotion effect of A. vagum on rice growth. Furthermore, the pathways of 39 overexpressed proteins in A. vagum were enriched in invading the host and inducing resistance. The knockouts of AvGH3, AvGH7, AvMFS1, and AvCBA transformed A. vagum role from endophyte to pathogen. The A. vagum-rice holobiont releases recruitment signals and improves the rice community structure.

We performed comparative genomic analyses on 70 fungal genomes from four families (Irpicaceae, Ceratocystidaceae, Nectriaceae, and Ophiostomataceae), including 24 ambrosia and 34 non-ambrosia lineages. Our phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple independent colonization of insect vectors by the fungi, spanning from the mid-Cretaceous (114.6 Ma) to the early Quaternary (1.9 Ma). Contrary to expectations for obligate symbionts, ambrosia fungi showed no significant genome-wide modification in size, gene count, or secreted protein repertoire compared to their non-symbiotic relatives. Instead, we observed conservation of most assessed genomic features; where genome traits differ between free-living relatives and ambrosia fungi, the changes are lineage-specific, not convergent. Key findings include lineage-specific expansions in carbohydrate-active enzyme families (AA4 in Nectriaceae, CE4 in Ophiostomataceae, and GH3 in Ophiostomataceae and Ceratocystidaceae), suggesting potential enhancement or loss of lignin modification, hemicellulose deacetylation, and cellulose degradation in different ambrosia lineages. Repeat-Induced Point mutation analysis revealed family-specific patterns rather than lifestyle-associated differences. These results highlight the diverse genomic strategies employed by ambrosia fungi, demonstrating that symbiont evolution can proceed through refined, lineage-specific changes rather than genome-wide, or convergent alterations. Our genomic analyses do not reveal patterns typically associated with domestication in these ambrosia fungi, suggesting they may represent free-living fungi that co-opted wood boring beetles as vectors through subtle, lineage-specific adaptations.",40036591

Gene families related to sperm hyperactivation and innate immunity, including lectins, were found to contain more genes in Ac. millepora relative to As. poculata. Sperm hyperactivation in Ac. millepora is expected given the extreme requirements of gamete competition during mass spawning events in tropical corals, while lectins are important in the establishment of coral-algal symbiosis. By contrast, gene families involved in sleep promotion, feeding suppression, and circadian sleep/wake cycle processes were expanded in As. poculata.

The protists are vertically inherited, which has generated a broad-scale pattern of codiversification over 150 million years, but there are many incongruences due to lineage-specific loss and transfer of symbionts. Despite the evolutionary and economic importance of this symbiosis, the symbiont communities of most termite species are incompletely characterized or entirely unstudied. Here, we have investigated the protist symbiont community of Reticulitermes tibialis, using single-cell PCR to link morphology to 18S rRNA gene sequences. The protists belong to at least 41 species in 3 major lineages within Metamonada: Spirotrichonymphida, Pyrsonymphidae, and Trichonympha. The Spirotrichonymphida symbionts belong to 6 genera, including Pseudospironympha, which has not been found in Reticulitermes until now, and Dexiohelix, a new genus. Pyrsonymphidae traditionally include just Pyrsonympha and Dinenympha, but our morphology-linked 18S phylogeny indicates that both genera are polyphyletic. We accordingly restrict the definitions of Pyrsonympha and Dinenympha to the clades that include their type species, and we propose 5 new genera to accommodate the remaining clades. Short-read 18S amplicon sequencing revealed considerable variation in community composition across R. tibialis colonies in Arizona, suggestive of a symbiont metacommunity. Symbiont species varied in their prevalence across colonies, with a core set of about 12 highly prevalent symbiont species, 11 species with intermediate prevalence, and 18 rare species. This pattern contrasts with the traditional paradigm of consistent symbiont community composition across colonies of a termite species.",39929034
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Non-ribosomal peptide synthase profiles remain structurally similar despite minimally shared features across fungus-farming termite microbiomes.,"Fungus-farming termites (Macrotermitinae) engage in an obligate mutualism with members of the fungal genus <i>Termitomyces</i>, which they maintain as a monoculture on specialized comb structures. Both these comb structures and the guts of the termites host diverse bacterial communities that are believed to assist in sustaining monoculture farming through antagonist suppression. Among candidate bacteria-derived compounds serving this function are non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), which are a highly bioactive class of specialized metabolites, frequently produced by symbionts within eukaryotic hosts. However, our understanding of specialized metabolites in termite-associated microbiomes is limited. Here we use amplicon sequencing to characterize both bacterial composition and NRP potential. We show that bacterial and NRP diversity are correlated and that the former varies more than the latter across termite host and gut and comb samples. Compositions of the two are governed by host species and sample type, with topological similarity indicating a diverse set of biosynthetic potential that is consistent with the long evolutionary history of the Macrotermitinae. The structure of both bacterial and NRP compositional networks varied similarly between guts and combs across the Macrotermitinae albeit with auxiliary termite genus-specific patterns. We observed minimal termite species-specific cores, with essentially no Macrotermitinae-wide core and an abundance of putatively novel biosynthetic gene clusters, suggesting that there is likely no single solution to antagonist suppression via specialized NRP metabolites. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the distribution of NRP potential in the farming termite symbiosis and will help guide targeted exploration of specialized metabolite production.",39902384
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Symbiosis vs pathogenesis in plants: Reflections and perspectives.,"Plant-microbe partnerships constitute a complex and intricately woven network of connections that have evolved over countless centuries, involving both cooperation and antagonism. In various contexts, plants and microorganisms engage in mutually beneficial partnerships that enhance crop health and maintain balance in ecosystems. However, these associations also render plants susceptible to a range of pathogens. Understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms governing these associations is crucial, given the notable susceptibility of plants to external environmental influences. Based on quorum sensing signals, phytohormone, and volatile organic carbon (VOC) production and others molecules, microorganisms influence plant growth, health, and defense responses. This review explores the multifaceted relationships between plants and their associated microorganisms, encompassing mutualism, commensalism, and antagonism. The molecular mechanisms of symbiotic and pathogenic interactions share similarities but lead to different outcomes. While symbiosis benefits both parties, pathogenesis harms the host. Genetic adaptations optimize these interactions, involving coevolution driving process. Environmental factors influence outcomes, emphasizing the need for understanding and manipulation of microbial communities for beneficial results. Research directions include employing multi-omics techniques, functional studies, investigating environmental factors, understanding evolutionary trajectories, and harnessing knowledge to engineer synthetic microbial consortia for sustainable agriculture and disease management.",39870251

Whether mutualistic fungi of the Serendipitaceae family, known for their extremely broad host range, use sRNAs to colonize plant roots is still under debate. To address this question, we developed a pipeline to validate the accumulation, translocation, and activity of fungal sRNAs in post-transcriptional silencing of Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Using stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we detected the expression of a specific set of Serendipita indica (Si) sRNAs, targeting host genes involved in cell wall organization, hormonal signalling regulation, immunity, and gene regulation. To confirm the gene silencing activity of these sRNAs in plant cells, SisRNAs were transiently expressed in protoplasts. Stem-loop PCR confirmed sRNA expression and accumulation, while qPCR validated post-transcriptional gene silencing of their predicted target genes. Furthermore, Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE 1 immunoprecipitation revealed the loading of fungal SisRNAs into the plant RNAi machinery, suggesting the translocation of SisRNA from the fungus into root cells. In conclusion, this study provides a blueprint for rapid selection and analysis of sRNA effectors and further supports the model of cross-kingdom communication in the Sebacinoid symbiosis.",39721982
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",The evolution of reduced facilitation in a four-species bacterial community.,"Microbial evolution is typically studied in monocultures or in communities of competing species. But microbes do not always compete and how positive inter-species interactions drive evolution is less clear: Initially facilitative communities may either evolve increased mutualism, increased reliance on certain species according to the Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH), or weaker interactions and resource specialization. To distinguish between these outcomes, we evolved four species for 44 weeks either alone or together in a toxic pollutant. These species initially facilitated each other, promoting each other's survival and pollutant degradation. After evolution, two species (<i>Microbacterium liquefaciens</i> and <i>Ochrobactrum anthropi</i>) that initially relied fully on others to survive continued to do so, with no evidence for increased mutualism. Instead, <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> and <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> (<i>Ct</i>) whose ancestors interacted positively, evolved in community to interact more neutrally and grew less well than when they had evolved alone, suggesting that the community limited their adaptation. We detected several gene loss events in <i>Ct</i> when evolving with others, but these events did not increase its reliance on other species, contrary to expectations under the BQH. We hypothesize instead that these gene loss events are a consequence of resource specialization. Finally, co-evolved communities degraded the pollutant worse than their ancestors. Together, our results support the evolution of weakened interactions and resource specialization, similar to what has been observed in competitive communities.",39677578

Domatia and leaf traits were measured, and the transcriptomes of mite domatia from two genotypes of V.riparia with distinct domatia sizes were sequenced to investigate the molecular genetic pathways that regulate domatia development and intraspecific variation in domatia traits. Key trichome regulators as well as auxin and jasmonic acid are involved in domatia development. Genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, biotic interactions, and molecule transport/metabolism are upregulated in domatia, consistent with their role in domatia development and function. This work is one of the first to date that provides insight into the molecular genetic bases of mite domatia.

This ""meta-organism"" symbiotic mutualism results in sweat either with or without odor (osmidrosis), depending on host ABCC11 gene haplotypes. Apocrine metabolism produces odorless S-glutathione conjugate that is transferred by ABCC11 transporters into secretory vesicles, deglutamylated to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH thiol, and exuded to skin surface. An anthropogenic clade of skin bacteria then takes up the thiol and bioconverts it to malodorous 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH). We hypothesized a familial meta-organism association of human ABCC11 gene non-synonymous SNP rs17822931 interplaying with skin microbiome 3M3SH biosynthesis. Subjects were genotyped for ABCC11 SNPs, and their haplotypes were correlated with axilla microbiome DNA sequencing profiles and predicted metagenome functions. A multigeneration family pedigree revealed a Mendelian autosomal recessive pattern: the C allele of ABCC11 correlated with bacterial Cys-S-conjugate -lyase (PatB) gene known for Staphylococcus hominis biosynthesis of 3M3SH from human precursor; PatB was rescinded in hosts with homozygous TT alleles encoding ABCC11 loss-of-function mutation. We posit that a C allele encoding functional ABCC11 is key to delivering host conjugate precursors that shape heritable skin niche conditions favorable to harboring Staphylococcus having genomics of odor thiol production.

During their extraordinary life cycle, these bacteria are capable of fine regulation of mutualism and pathogenesis towards two different hosts, a nematode and a wide range of insect species, respectively. Consequently, survival in a specific ecological niche favours the richness of biosynthetic gene clusters and respective metabolites with a specific structure and function, providing templates for uncovering new agrochemicals and therapeutics.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Gene expression signatures of mutualism and pathogenesis in flax roots.,"Fusarium wilt, a devastating soil-borne fungal disease in flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>), is caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini</i>, a hemibiotrophic plant pathogen that penetrates plant roots. There are several reports of the molecular response of <i>L. usitatissimum</i> to <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini</i>; however, comparisons of the effects of mutualistic and pathogenic fungi on plants are more limited. In this study, we have integrated phenotyping and RNA-Seq approaches to examine the response of flax to <i>F. oxysporum</i> f.sp. lini and to a mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) <i>Rhizoglomus irregulare</i>. <i>R. irregulare</i> is a common soil fungus and also widely used as a commercial inoculant to improve plant growth. We measured flax growth parameters after plant inoculation with each or both fungi, in comparison with non-inoculated control. We performed transcriptome analysis of root tissues collected at 9 and 14 days post-inoculation. We identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to pathogenic and mutualistic fungi. These included genes related to ethylene and salicylic acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate binding, oxidoreductases, and sugar transmembrane transporters. Genes related to calcium signaling, nutrient transport, lipid metabolism, cell wall, and polysaccharide-modifying were up-regulated by <i>R. irregulare</i>; however, the same genes were down-regulated by <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini</i> when treated independently. In the combined treatment, genes related to cell wall modifications, hormone regulation and nutrient uptake were up-regulated. These results suggest that inoculation with <i>R. irregulare</i> reduced gene expression related to <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lini</i> infection, leading to a reduced response to the pathogen. In response to AMF, flax prioritized mutualism-related gene expression over defense, reversing the growth inhibition caused by <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp.<i>lini</i> in the combined treatment. This research provides insights into the protective effects of AMF, revealing the pre-symbiotic gene expression profile of flax in response to mutualism in comparison with pathogenicity.

Nevertheless, the last decade marked a fruitful era of dinoflagellate genomics, with 27 genomes sequenced and many insights attained. This review aims to synthesize information from these genomes, along with other omic data, to reflect on where we are now in understanding dinoflagellates and where we are heading in the future. The most notable insights from the decade-long genomics work include: (1) dinoflagellate genomes have been expanded in multiple times independently, probably by a combination of rampant retroposition, accumulation of repetitive DNA, and genome duplication; (2) Symbiodiniacean genomes are highly divergent, but share about 3,445 core unigenes concentrated in 219 KEGG pathways; (3) Most dinoflagellate genes are encoded unidirectionally and are not intron-poor; (4) The dinoflagellate nucleus has undergone extreme evolutionary changes, including complete or nearly complete loss of nucleosome and histone H1, and acquisition of dinoflagellate viral nuclear protein (DVNP); (5) Major basic nuclear protein (MBNP), histone-like protein (HLP), and bacterial HU-like protein (HCc) belong to the same protein family, and MBNP can be the unifying name; (6) Dinoflagellate gene expression is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms, but microRNA and other epigenetic mechanisms are likely important; (7) Over 50% of dinoflagellate genes are ""dark"" and their functions remain to be deciphered using functional genetics; (8) Initial insights into the genomic basis of parasitism and mutualism have emerged.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Trade-off between photosymbiosis and innate immunity influences cnidarian's response to pathogenic bacteria.,"Mutualistic relationships with photosynthetic organisms are common in cnidarians, which form an intracellular symbiosis with dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae. The establishment and maintenance of these symbionts are associated with the suppression of key host immune factors. Because of this, there are potential trade-offs between the nutrition that cnidarian hosts gain from their symbionts and their ability to successfully defend themselves from pathogens. To investigate these potential trade-offs, we utilized the facultatively symbiotic polyps of the upside-down jellyfish <i>Cassiopea xamachana</i> and exposed aposymbiotic and symbiotic polyps to the pathogen <i>Serratia marcescens</i>. Symbiotic polyps had a lower probability of survival following <i>S. marcescens</i> exposure. Gene expression analyses 24 hours following pathogen exposure indicate that symbiotic animals mounted a more damaging immune response, with higher levels of inflammation and oxidative stress likely resulting in more severe disruptions to cellular homeostasis. Underlying this more damaging immune response may be differences in constitutive and pathogen-induced expression of immune transcription factors between aposymbiotic and symbiotic polyps rather than broadscale immune suppression during symbiosis. Our findings indicate that in facultatively symbiotic polyps, hosting symbionts limits <i>C. xamachana'</i>s ability to survive pathogen exposure, indicating a trade-off between symbiosis and immunity that has potential implications for coral disease research.",39353557
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Dispersal limitation determines the ecological processes that regulate the seasonal assembly of bacterial communities in a subtropical river.,"Bacteria play a crucial role in pollutant degradation, biogeochemical cycling, and energy flow within river ecosystems. However, the underlying mechanisms governing bacterial community assembly and their response to environmental factors at seasonal scales in subtropical rivers remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on water samples from the Liuxi River to investigate the composition, assembly processes, and co-occurrence relationships of bacterial communities during the wet season and dry season. The results demonstrated that seasonal differences in hydrochemistry significantly influenced the composition of bacterial communities. A more heterogeneous community structure and increased alpha diversity were observed during the dry season. Water temperature emerged as the primary driver for seasonal changes in bacterial communities. Dispersal limitation predominantly governed community assembly, however, during the dry season, its contribution increased due to decreased immigration rates. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that mutualism played a prevailing role in shaping bacterial community structure. Compared to the wet season, the network of bacterial communities exhibited higher modularity, competition, and keystone species during the dry season, resulting in a more stable community structure. Although keystone species displayed distinct seasonal variations, <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i> were consistently abundant keystone species maintaining network structure in both seasons. Our findings provide insights into how bacterial communities respond to seasonal environmental changes, uncovering underlying mechanisms governing community assembly in subtropical rivers, which are crucial for the effective management and conservation of riverine ecosystems.",39252829
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Bacterial cross-feeding can promote gene retention by lowering gene expression costs.,"Gene loss is expected in microbial communities when the benefit of obtaining a biosynthetic precursor from a neighbor via cross-feeding outweighs the cost of retaining a biosynthetic gene. However, gene cost primarily comes from expression, and many biosynthetic genes are only expressed when needed. Thus, one can conversely expect cross-feeding to repress biosynthetic gene expression and promote gene retention by lowering gene cost. Here we examined long-term bacterial cocultures pairing <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> for evidence of gene loss or retention in response to cross-feeding of non-essential adenine. Although <i>R. palustris</i> continued to externalize adenine in long-term cultures, <i>E. coli</i> did not accumulate mutations in purine synthesis genes, even after 700 generations. <i>E. coli</i> purine synthesis gene expression was low in coculture, suggesting that gene repression removed selective pressure for gene loss. In support of this explanation, <i>R. palustris</i> also had low transcript levels for iron-scavenging siderophore genes in coculture, likely because <i>E. coli</i> facilitated iron acquisition by <i>R. palustris</i>. <i>R. palustris</i> siderophore gene mutations were correspondingly rare in long-term cocultures but were prevalent in monocultures where transcript levels were high. Our data suggests that cross-feeding does not always drive gene loss, but can instead promote gene retention by repressing costly expression.",39229193

Here, we describe an agricultural field study of pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium) flower pollination. Pyrethrum is genetically self-incompatible and thus is reliant on pollinators for seed set. Our pollinator exclusion experiment showed that nocturnal insects, particularly moths, significantly contribute to seed set and quality. We discovered that the most abundant floral volatile, the sesquiterpene (-)-germacrene D (GD), is key in attracting the noctuid moths Peridroma saucia and Helicoverpa armigera. Germacrene D synthase (GDS) gene expression regulates the specific GD production and accumulation in flowers, which, in contrast to related species, lose the habit of closing at night. We did observe that female moths also oviposited on pyrethrum leaves and flower peduncles, but found that only a small fraction of those eggs hatched. Larvae were severely stunted in development, most likely due to the presence of pyrethrin defense compounds. This example of exploitative mutualism, which blocks the reproductive success of the moth pollinator and depends on nocturnal interactions, is placed into an ecological context to explain why it may have developed.",39205445

To utilize subtle nutrient differences and rapidly screen for key genes related to the interaction between <i>Suillus luteus</i> and <i>Pinus massoniana</i>, we performed an inoculation experiment using culture bottles containing high- and low-nutrient media. Interestingly, <i>S. luteus</i> LS88 promoted the growth of <i>P. massoniana</i> seedlings without mature ectomycorrhiza, and the impact of LS88 inoculation on <i>P. massoniana</i> roots was greater than that of nutrient changes. In this study, the resequenced genome of the LS88 strain was utilized for transcriptome analysis of the strain. The analysis indicated that a unique gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) in LS88 is likely involved in colonizing <i>P. massoniana</i> roots. In this study, the GST gene expression was independent of nutrient levels.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",The evolution of autonomy from two cooperative specialists in fluctuating environments.,"From microbes to humans, organisms perform numerous tasks for their survival, including food acquisition, migration, and reproduction. A complex biological task can be performed by either an autonomous organism or by cooperation among several specialized organisms. However, it remains unclear how autonomy and cooperation evolutionarily switch. Specifically, it remains unclear whether and how cooperative specialists can repair deleted genes through direct genetic exchange, thereby regaining metabolic autonomy. Here, we address this question by experimentally evolving a mutualistic microbial consortium composed of two specialists that cooperatively degrade naphthalene. We observed that autonomous genotypes capable of performing the entire naphthalene degradation pathway evolved from two cooperative specialists and dominated the community. This evolutionary transition was driven by the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between the two specialists. However, this evolution was exclusively observed in the fluctuating environment alternately supplied with naphthalene and pyruvate, where mutualism and competition between the two specialists alternated. The naphthalene-supplied environment exerted selective pressure that favors the expansion of autonomous genotypes. The pyruvate-supplied environment promoted the coexistence and cell density of the cooperative specialists, thereby increasing the likelihood of HGT. Using a mathematical model, we quantitatively demonstrate that environmental fluctuations facilitate the evolution of autonomy through HGT when the relative growth rate and carrying capacity of the cooperative specialists allow enhanced coexistence and higher cell density in the competitive environment. Together, our results demonstrate that cooperative specialists can repair deleted genes through a direct genetic exchange under specific conditions, thereby regaining metabolic autonomy.",39172793

Furthermore, cyanobacteria can form mutualistic symbiotic relationships with a diverse set of eukaryotes, including land plants, aquatic plankton and fungi. Nevertheless, not all cyanobacteria are found in symbiotic associations suggesting symbiotic cyanobacteria have evolved specializations that facilitate host-interactions. Photosynthetic capabilities, nitrogen fixation, and the production of complex biochemicals are key functions provided by host-associated cyanobacterial symbionts. To explore if additional specializations are associated with such lifestyles in cyanobacteria, we have conducted comparative phylogenomics of molecular functions and of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in 984 cyanobacterial genomes. Cyanobacteria with host-associated and symbiotic lifestyles were concentrated in the family Nostocaceae, where eight monophyletic clades correspond to specific host taxa. In agreement with previous studies, symbionts are likely to provide fixed nitrogen to their eukaryotic partners, through multiple different nitrogen fixation pathways. Additionally, our analyses identified chitin metabolising pathways in cyanobacteria associated with specific host groups, while obligate symbionts had fewer BGCs. The conservation of molecular functions and BGCs between closely related symbiotic and free-living cyanobacteria suggests the potential for additional cyanobacteria to form symbiotic relationships than is currently known.",39134591
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Few chemoreceptor genes in the ambrosia beetleTrypodendron lineatummay reflect its specialized ecology.,"Chemoreception is crucial for insect fitness, underlying for instance food-, host-, and mate finding. Chemicals in the environment are detected by receptors from three divergent gene families: odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), and ionotropic receptors (IRs). However, how the chemoreceptor gene families evolve in parallel with ecological specializations remains poorly understood, especially in the order Coleoptera. Hence, we sequenced the genome and annotated the chemoreceptor genes of the specialised ambrosia beetle Trypodendron lineatum (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) and compared its chemoreceptor gene repertoires with those of other scolytines with different ecological adaptations, as well as a polyphagous cerambycid species. We identified 67 ORs, 38 GRs, and 44 IRs in T. lineatum ('Tlin'). Across gene families, T. lineatum has fewer chemoreceptors compared to related scolytines, the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei and the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae, and clearly fewer receptors than the polyphagous cerambycid Anoplophora glabripennis. The comparatively low number of chemoreceptors is largely explained by the scarcity of large receptor lineage radiations, especially among the bitter taste GRs and the 'divergent' IRs, and the absence of alternatively spliced GR genes. Only one non-fructose sugar receptor was found, suggesting several sugar receptors have been lost. Also, we found no orthologue in the 'GR215 clade', which is widely conserved across Coleoptera. Two TlinORs are orthologous to ORs that are functionally conserved across curculionids, responding to 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) and green leaf volatiles (GLVs), respectively. Trypodendron lineatum reproduces inside the xylem of decaying conifers where it feeds on its obligate fungal mutualist Phialophoropsis ferruginea. Like previous studies, our results suggest that stenophagy correlates with small chemoreceptor numbers in wood-boring beetles; indeed, the few GRs may be due to its restricted fungal diet. The presence of TlinORs orthologous to those detecting 2-PE and GLVs in other species suggests these compounds are important for T. lineatum. Future functional studies should test this prediction, and chemoreceptor annotations should be conducted on additional ambrosia beetle species to investigate whether few chemoreceptors is a general trait in this specialized group of beetles.",39107741

We also found significant differences in reproductive strategies, with <i>F. eximia</i> producing more pistillate flowers and, consequently, more seeds and pollinating wasps per fig than <i>F. citrifolia</i>, likely as an adaptation to overcome limitations of low population density by maximizing the gene flow. As the shorter-lived organism, the fig wasp was found to influence critical processes associated with the success and stability of mutualism, such as fig development and ripening.

Integrating results across analyses is also important for understanding gene function. To address these challenges, we present the Beav annotation pipeline. Beav is a command-line tool that automates the annotation of bacterial genome sequences, mobile genetic elements, molecular systems and gene clusters, key regulatory features, and other elements. Beav uses existing tools in addition to custom models, scripts, and databases to annotate diverse elements, systems, and sequence features. Custom databases for plant-associated microbes are incorporated to improve annotation of key virulence and symbiosis genes in agriculturally important pathogens and mutualists. Beav includes an optional <i>Agrobacterium</i>-specific pipeline that identifies and classifies oncogenic plasmids and annotates plasmid-specific features. Following the completion of all analyses, annotations are consolidated to produce a single comprehensive output. Finally, Beav generates publication-quality genome and plasmid maps. Beav is on Bioconda and is available for download at https://github.com/weisberglab/beav. Annotation of genome features, such as the presence of genes and their predicted function, or larger loci encoding secretion systems or biosynthetic gene clusters, is necessary for understanding the functions encoded by an organism. Genomes can also host diverse mobile genetic elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements and/or phages, that are often not annotated by existing pipelines. These elements can horizontally mobilize genes encoding for virulence, antimicrobial resistance, or other adaptive functions and alter the phenotype of an organism. We developed a software pipeline, called Beav, that combines new and existing tools for the comprehensive annotation of these and other major features. Existing pipelines often misannotate loci important for virulence or mutualism in plant-associated bacteria. Beav includes custom databases and optional workflows for the improved annotation of plant-associated bacteria.

Proton-conductive medium (PCM) was applied to construct efficient proton transport pathway, and a large number of protons from extracellular water were found available to upregulate methanogenesis in AD, as indicated by the increase in the content of <sup>2</sup>H (D) in methane molecules (over 40.7%), among which CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction-to-CH<sub>4</sub> was effectively enhanced. The increases of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration (+54.1%) and gene expression activities related to ATPase (+100.0%) and proton pump (+580.1%) revealed that enhanced EPT by PCM promoted transmembrane proton motive force generation to facilitate ATP synthesis. Based on genome-centric metatranscriptomic analyses, MAG14, MAG63 and MAG61 with high energy conservation activity displayed most pronounced positive response to the EPT enhancement. In these core MAGs, the metabolic pathway reconstruction and the key genes activity identification further proved that EPT enhancement-driven efficient ATP synthesis stimulated the cross-feeding of carbon and proton/electron to facilitate microbial mutualism, thereby resulting in the high energy-conserving methanogenesis. Overall, our work provides new insights into how EPT enhancement drives high energy-conserving methanogenesis, expanding our understanding of the ecological role of EPT in AD.",39018580
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Functional diversity of bacterial microbiota associated with the toxigenic benthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum.,"Interactions between bacterial microbiota and epibenthic species of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum may define the onset and persistence of benthic harmful algal blooms (bHABs). Chemical ecological interactions within the dinoflagellate phycosphere potentially involve a complex variety of organic molecules, metabolites, and toxins, including undefined bioactive compounds. In this study, the bacterial diversity and core members of the dinoflagellate-associated microbiota were defined from 11 strains of three epibenthic Prorocentrum species, representing three geographically disjunct locations within Mexican coastal waters. Microbiota profiles in stable monoclonal Prorocentrum cultures were obtained by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen classes of bacteria were identified among dinoflagellate clones, where Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia were consistently dominant. The bacterial community structure exhibited significantly different grouping by the location of origin of dinoflagellate clones. No significant diversity difference was found among free-living or unattached bacteria in the dinoflagellate culture medium (M) compared with those in closer association with the dinoflagellate host cells (H). Twelve taxa were defined as core members of the bacterial assemblage, representing the genera Algiphilus, Cohaesibacter, Labrenzia, Mameliella, Marinobacter, Marivita, Massilia, Muricauda, Roseitalea, and an unclassified member of the Rhodobacteraceae. The core members are inferred to significantly contribute to primary and secondary metabolic functions, but no direct correlation with dinoflagellate toxigenicity was apparent. Overall the bacterial profile and implied gene functionality indicated a suite of positive interactions, suggesting either mutualism or commensalism with the dinoflagellate. The further characterization and interpretation of specific gene functions and interactions between bacteria and dinoflagellates, such as epibenthic members of genus Prorocentrum, are key to understanding their role in toxigenesis and bHAB development.",39012861
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Microbial diversity and ecological complexity emerging from environmental variation and horizontal gene transfer in a simple mathematical model.,"Microbiomes are generally characterized by high diversity of coexisting microbial species and strains, and microbiome composition typically remains stable across a broad range of conditions. However, under fixed conditions, microbial ecology conforms with the exclusion principle under which two populations competing for the same resource within the same niche cannot coexist because the less fit population inevitably goes extinct. Therefore, the long-term persistence of microbiome diversity calls for an explanation. To explore the conditions for stabilization of microbial diversity, we developed a simple mathematical model consisting of two competing populations that could exchange a single gene allele via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We found that, although in a fixed environment, with unbiased HGT, the system obeyed the exclusion principle, in an oscillating environment, within large regions of the phase space bounded by the rates of reproduction and HGT, the two populations coexist. Moreover, depending on the parameter combination, all three major types of symbiosis were obtained, namely, pure competition, host-parasite relationship, and mutualism. In each of these regimes, certain parameter combinations provided for synergy, that is, a greater total abundance of both populations compared to the abundance of the winning population in the fixed environment. The results of this modeling study show that basic phenomena that are universal in microbial communities, namely, environmental variation and HGT, provide for stabilization and persistence of microbial diversity, and emergence of ecological complexity.",38965531
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Does coevolution in refugia drive mimicry in bumble bees? Insights from a South Asian mimicry group.,"Mllerian mimicry was proposed to be an example of a coevolved mutualism promoted by population isolation in glacial refugia. This, however, has not been well supported in butterfly models. Here, we use genomic data to test this theory while examining the population genetics behind mimetic diversification in a pair of co-mimetic bumble bees, <i>Bombus breviceps</i> Smith and <i>Bombus trifasciatus</i> Smith. In both lineages, populations were structured by geography but not as much by color pattern, suggesting sharing of color alleles across regions of restricted gene flow and formation of mimicry complexes in the absence of genetic differentiation. Demographic analyses showed mismatches between historical effective population size changes and glacial cycles, and niche modeling revealed only mild habitat retraction during glaciation. Moreover, mimetic subpopulations of the same color form in the two lineages only in some cases exhibit similar population history and genetic divergence. Therefore, the current study supports a more complex history in this comimicry than a simple refugium-coevolution model.",38865449
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary history of tyrosine-supplementing endosymbionts in pollen-feeding beetles.,"Many insects feeding on nutritionally challenging diets like plant sap, leaves, or wood engage in ancient associations with bacterial symbionts that supplement limiting nutrients or produce digestive or detoxifying enzymes. However, the distribution, function, and evolutionary dynamics of microbial symbionts in insects exploiting other plant tissues or relying on a predacious diet remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the evolutionary history and function of the intracellular gamma-proteobacterial symbiont ""Candidatus Dasytiphilus stammeri"" in soft-winged flower beetles (Coleoptera, Melyridae, Dasytinae) that transition from saprophagy or carnivory to palynivory (pollen-feeding) between larval and adult stage. Reconstructing the distribution of the symbiont within the Dasytinae phylogeny unraveled not only a long-term coevolution, originating from a single acquisition event with subsequent host-symbiont codiversification, but also several independent symbiont losses. The analysis of 20 different symbiont genomes revealed that their genomes are severely eroded. However, the universally retained shikimate pathway indicates that the core metabolic contribution to their hosts is the provisioning of tyrosine for cuticle sclerotization and melanization. Despite the high degree of similarity in gene content and order across symbiont strains, the capacity to synthesize additional essential amino acids and vitamins and to recycle urea is retained in some but not all symbionts, suggesting ecological differences among host lineages. This report of tyrosine-provisioning symbionts in insects with saprophagous or carnivorous larvae and pollen-feeding adults expands our understanding of tyrosine supplementation as an important symbiont-provided benefit across a broad range of insects with diverse feeding ecologies.",38861456

The causes and behavior of algal blooms are complex and vary across different regions. As bacterial interactions with algal species are increasingly recognized as a key factor driving algal blooms, the present study identifies several bacterial candidates potentially associated with Chilean Alexandrium catenella. This research narrowed down the selection of bacteria from the Chilean A. catenella culture using antibiotic treatment and 16S rRNA metabarcoding analysis. Subsequently, seawater from two Chilean coastal stations, Isla Julia and Isla San Pedro, was monitored for two years to detect Alexandrium species and the selected bacteria, utilizing 16S and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding analyses. The results suggested a potential association between Alexandrium species and Spongiibacteraceae at both stations.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Mutualistic interactions of lactate-producing lactobacilli and lactate-utilizing Veillonella dispar: Lactate and glutamate cross-feeding for the enhanced growth and short-chain fatty acid production.,"The human gut hosts numerous ecological niches for microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Gut lactate homeostasis in humans is crucial and relies on various bacteria. Veillonella spp., gut lactate-utilizing bacteria, and lactate-producing bacteria were frequently co-isolated. A recent clinical trial has revealed that lactate-producing bacteria in humans cross-feed lactate to Veillonella spp.; however, their interspecies interaction mechanisms remain unclear. Veillonella dispar, an obligate anaerobe commonly found in the human gut and oral cavity, ferments lactate into acetate and propionate. In our study, we investigated the interaction between V.dispar ATCC 17748<sup>T</sup> and three representative phylogenetically distant strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356<sup>T</sup>, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ATCC 27216<sup>T</sup>, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ATCC 10241. Bacterial growth, viability, metabolism and gene level adaptations during bacterial interaction were examined. V.dispar exhibited the highest degree of mutualism with L.acidophilus. During co-culture of V.dispar with L.acidophilus, both bacteria exhibited enhanced growth and increased viability. V.dispar demonstrated an upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways and the aspartate catabolic pathway. L.acidophilus also showed a considerable number of upregulated genes related to growth and lactate fermentation. Our results support that V.dispar is able to enhance the fermentative capability of L.acidophilus by presumably consuming the produced lactate, and that L.acidophilus cross-feed not only lactate, but also glutamate, to V.dispar during co-culture. The cross-fed glutamate enters the central carbon metabolism in V.dispar. These findings highlight an intricate metabolic relationship characterized by cross-feeding of lactate and glutamate in parallel with considerable gene regulation within both L.acidophilus (lactate-producing) and V.dispar (lactate-utilizing). The mechanisms of mutualistic interactions between a traditional probiotic bacterium and a potential next-generation probiotic bacterium were elucidated in the production of short-chain fatty acids.",38801349
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs play important roles in nutrient cycling within cyanobacterial Microcystis bloom microbiomes.,"During the bloom season, the colonial cyanobacterium Microcystis forms complex aggregates which include a diverse microbiome within an exopolymer matrix. Early research postulated a simple mutualism existing with bacteria benefitting from the rich source of fixed carbon and Microcystis receiving recycled nutrients. Researchers have since hypothesized that Microcystis aggregates represent a community of synergistic and interacting species, an interactome, each with unique metabolic capabilities that are critical to the growth, maintenance, and demise of Microcystis blooms. Research has also shown that aggregate-associated bacteria are taxonomically different from free-living bacteria in the surrounding water. Moreover, research has identified little overlap in functional potential between Microcystis and members of its microbiome, further supporting the interactome concept. However, we still lack verification of general interaction and know little about the taxa and metabolic pathways supporting nutrient and metabolite cycling within Microcystis aggregates. During a 7-month study of bacterial communities comparing free-living and aggregate-associated bacteria in Lake Taihu, China, we found that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria were significantly more abundant within Microcystis aggregates than in free-living samples, suggesting a possible functional role for AAP bacteria in overall aggregate community function. We then analyzed gene composition in 102 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of bloom-microbiome bacteria from 10 lakes spanning four continents, compared with 12 complete Microcystis genomes which revealed that microbiome bacteria and Microcystis possessed complementary biochemical pathways that could serve in C, N, S, and P cycling. Mapping published transcripts from Microcystis blooms onto a comprehensive AAP and non-AAP bacteria MAG database (226 MAGs) indicated that observed high levels of expression of genes involved in nutrient cycling pathways were in AAP bacteria. Our results provide strong corroboration of the hypothesized Microcystis interactome and the first evidence that AAP bacteria may play an important role in nutrient cycling within Microcystis aggregate microbiomes.

The bacteria encounter DNA-rich mucus throughout their transition to a symbiotic lifestyle, leading us to hypothesize a role for nuclease activity in the colonization process. In support of this, we detected abundant extracellular nuclease activity in growing cells of <i>V. fischeri</i>. To discover the gene(s) responsible for this activity, we screened a <i>V. fischeri</i> transposon mutant library for nuclease-deficient strains. Interestingly, only one strain, whose transposon insertion mapped to nuclease gene <i>VF_1451</i>, showed a complete loss of nuclease activity in our screens. A database search revealed that <i>VF_1451</i> is homologous to the nuclease-encoding gene <i>xds</i> in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. However, <i>V. fischeri</i> strains lacking <i>xds</i> eventually revealed slight nuclease activity on plates upon prolonged incubation. This led us to hypothesize that a second secreted nuclease, identified through a database search as <i>VF_0437</i>, a homolog of <i>V. cholerae dns</i>, might be responsible for the residual nuclease activity. Here, we show that Xds and/or Dns are involved in essential aspects of <i>V. fischeri</i> biology, including natural transformation, aggregation, and phosphate scavenging. Furthermore, strains lacking either nuclease were outcompeted by the wild type for squid colonization. Understanding the specific role of nuclease activity in the squid colonization process represents an intriguing area of future research.IMPORTANCEFrom soil and water to host-associated secretions such as mucus, environments that bacteria inhabit are awash in DNA. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a nutritious resource that microbes dedicate significant energy to exploit. Calcium binds eDNA to promote cell-cell aggregation and horizontal gene transfer. eDNA hydrolysis impacts the construction of and dispersal from biofilms. Strategies in which pathogens use nucleases to avoid phagocytosis or disseminate by degrading host secretions are well-documented; significantly less is known about nucleases in mutualistic associations. This study describes the role of nucleases in the mutualism between <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and its squid host <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>. We find that nuclease activity is an important determinant of colonization in <i>V. fischeri</i>, broadening our understanding of how microbes establish and maintain beneficial associations.",38712952
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular Insights into Plant-Microbe Interactions: A Comprehensive Review of Key Mechanisms.,"In most ecosystems, plants establish complex symbiotic relationships with organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, which significantly influence their health by promoting or inhibiting growth. These relationships involve biochemical exchanges at the cellular level that affect plant physiology and have evolutionary implications, such as species diversification, horizontal gene transfer, symbiosis and mutualism, environmental adaptation, and positive impacts on community structure and biodiversity. For these reasons, contemporary research, moving beyond observational studies, seeks to elucidate the molecular basis of these interactions; however, gaps in knowledge remain. This is particularly noticeable in understanding how plants distinguish between beneficial and antagonistic microorganisms. In light of the above, this literature review aims to address some of these gaps by exploring the key mechanisms in common interspecies relationships. Thus, our study presents novel insights into these evolutionary archetypes, focusing on the antibiosis process and microbial signaling, including chemotaxis and quorum sensing. Additionally, it examined the biochemical basis of endophytism, pre-mRNA splicing, and transcriptional plasticity, highlighting the roles of transcription factors and epigenetic regulation in the functions of the interacting organisms. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding these confluences in natural environments, which are crucial for future theoretical and practical applications, such as improving plant nutrition, protecting against pathogens, developing transgenic crops, sustainable agriculture, and researching disease mechanisms. It was concluded that because of the characteristics of the various biomolecules involved in these biological interactions, there are interconnected molecular networks in nature that give rise to different ecological scaffolds. These networks integrate a myriad of functionally organic units that belong to various kingdoms. This interweaving underscores the complexity and multidisciplinary integration required to understand plant-microbe interactions at the molecular level. Regarding the limitations inherent in this study, it is recognized that researchers face significant obstacles. These include technical difficulties in experimentation and fieldwork, as well as the arduous task of consolidating and summarizing findings for academic articles. Challenges range from understanding complex ecological and molecular dynamics to unbiased and objective interpretation of diverse and ever-changing literature.",38538528
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",In vivo interference of pea aphid endosymbiont Buchnera groEL gene by synthetic peptide nucleic acids.,"The unculturable nature of intracellular obligate symbionts presents a significant challenge for elucidating gene functionality, necessitating the development of gene manipulation techniques. One of the best-studied obligate symbioses is that between aphids and the bacterial endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola. Given the extensive genome reduction observed inBuchnera, the remaining genes are crucial for understanding the host-symbiont relationship, but a lack of tools for manipulating gene function in the endosymbiont has significantly impeded the exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying this mutualism. In this study, we introduced a novel gene manipulation technique employing synthetic single-stranded peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). We targeted the critical Buchnera groELusing specially designed antisense PNAs conjugated to an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Within 24h of PNA administration via microinjection, we observed a significant reduction in groEL expression and Buchnera cell count. Notably,the interference of groEL led to profound morphological malformations in Buchnera, indicative of impaired cellular integrity.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Interspecific interactions facilitate keystone species in a multispecies biofilm that promotes plant growth.,"Microorganisms colonizing plant roots co-exist in complex, spatially structured multispecies biofilm communities. However, little is known about microbial interactions and the underlying spatial organization within biofilm communities established on plant roots. Here, a well-established four-species biofilm model (Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Paenibacillus amylolyticus, Microbacterium oxydans, and Xanthomonas retroflexus, termed as SPMX) was applied to Arabidopsis roots to study the impact of multispecies biofilm on plant growth and the community spatial dynamics on the roots. SPMX co-culture notably promoted root development and plant biomass. Co-cultured SPMX increased root colonization and formed multispecies biofilms, structurally different from those formed by monocultures. By combining 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization with confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that the composition and spatial organization of the four-species biofilm significantly changed over time. Monoculture P. amylolyticus colonized plant roots poorly, but its population and root colonization were highly enhanced when residing in the four-species biofilm. Exclusion of P. amylolyticus from the community reduced overall biofilm production and root colonization of the three species, resulting in the loss of the plant growth-promoting effects. Combined with spatial analysis, this led to identification of P. amylolyticus as a keystone species. Our findings highlight that weak root colonizers may benefit from mutualistic interactions in complex communities and hereby become important keystone species impacting community spatial organization and function. This work expands the knowledge on spatial organization uncovering interspecific interactions in multispecies biofilm communities on plant roots, beneficial for harnessing microbial mutualism promoting plant growth.",38365935

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular insights into the mutualism that induces iron deficiency tolerance in sorghum inoculated with Trichoderma harzianum.,"Iron (Fe) deficiency is a common mineral stress in plants, including sorghum. Although the soil fungus Trichoderma harzianum has been shown to mitigate Fe deficiency in some circumstances, neither the range nor mechanism(s) of this process are well understood. In this study, high pH-induced Fe deficiency in sorghum cultivated in pots with natural field soil exhibited a significant decrease in biomass, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and Fe-uptake in both the root and shoot. However, the establishment of T. harzianum colonization in roots of Fe-deprived sorghum showed significant improvements in morpho-physiological traits, Fe levels, and redox status. Molecular detection of the fungal ThAOX1 (L-aminoacid oxidase) gene showed the highest colonization of T. harzianum in the root tips of Fe-deficient sorghum, a location thus targeted for further analysis. Expression studies by RNA-seq and qPCR in sorghum root tips revealed a significant upregulation of several genes associated with Fe uptake (SbTOM2), auxin synthesis (SbSAURX15), nicotianamine synthase 3 (SbNAS3), and a phytosiderophore transporter (SbYS1). Also induced was the siderophore synthesis gene (ThSIT1) in T. harzianum, a result supported by biochemical evidence for elevated siderophore and IAA (indole acetic acid) levels in roots. Given the high affinity of fungal siderophore to chelate insoluble Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, it is likely that elevated siderophore released by T. harzianum led to Fe(III)-siderophore complexes in the rhizosphere that were then transported into roots by the induced SbYS1 (yellow-stripe 1) transporter. In addition, the observed induction of several plant peroxidase genes and ABA (abscisic acid) under Fe deficiency after inoculation with T. harzianum may have helped induce tolerance to Fe-deficiency-induced oxidative stress and adaptive responses. This is the first mechanistic explanation for T. harzianum's role in helping alleviate Fe deficiency in sorghum and suggests that biofertilizers using T. harzianum will improve Fe availability to crops in high pH environments.",38295681

We used transcriptome sequences of 25 fig wasps from six genera to explore the evolution of key molecular components of fig wasp chemosensory genes: odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs). We identified a total 321 OBPs and 240 CSPs, with each species recording from 6 to 27 OBP genes and 6-19 CSP genes. 318 OBP genes are clustered into 17 orthologous groups and can be divided into two groups: PBP sensitive to pheromone and GOBP sensitive to general odor molecules, such as alcohols, esters, acids, ketones, and terpenoids. 240 CSP genes are clustered into 12 orthologous groups, which can be divided into three major groups and have functions, such as olfactory, tissue formation and/or regeneration, developmental, and some specific and unknown function. The gene sequences of most orthologous groups vary greatly among species and are consistent with the phylogenetic relationships between fig wasps. Strong purifying selection of both OBP and CSP genes was detected, as shown by low  values. A positive selection was detected in one locus in CSP1. In conclusion, the evolution of chemosensory proteins OBPs and CSPs in fig wasps is relatively conservative, and they play an indispensable role in the life activities of fig wasps.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",- Invited Review - Chemical signalling within the rumen microbiome.,"Ruminants possess a specialized four-compartment forestomach, consisting of the reticulum, rumen, omasum, and abomasum. The rumen, the primary fermentative chamber, harbours a dynamic ecosystem comprising bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and bacteriophages. These microorganisms engage in diverse ecological interactions within the rumen microbiome, primarily benefiting the host animal by deriving energy from plant material breakdown. These interactions encompass symbiosis, such as mutualism and commensalism, as well as parasitism, predation, and competition. These ecological interactions are dependent on many factors, including the production of diverse molecules, such as those involved in quorum sensing (QS). QS is a density-dependent signalling mechanism involving the release of autoinducer (AIs) compounds, when cell density increases AIs bind to receptors causing the altered expression of certain genes. These AIs are classified as mainly being N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL; commonly used by Gram-negative bacteria) or autoinducer-2 based systems (AI-2; used by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria); although other less common AI systems exist. Most of our understanding of QS at a gene-level comes from pure culture in vitro studies using bacterial pathogens, with much being unknown on a commensal bacterial and ecosystem level, especially in the context of the rumen microbiome. A small number of studies have explored QS in the rumen using 'omic' technologies, revealing a prevalence of AI-2 QS systems among rumen bacteria. Nevertheless, the implications of these signalling systems on gene regulation, rumen ecology, and ruminant characteristics are largely uncharted territory. Metatranscriptome data tracking the colonization of perennial ryegrass by rumen microbes suggest that these chemicals may influence transitions in bacterial diversity during colonization. The likelihood of undiscovered chemicals within the rumen microbial arsenal is high, with the identified chemicals representing only the tip of the iceberg. A comprehensive grasp of rumen microbial chemical signalling is crucial for addressing the challenges of food security and climate targets.",38186253

Through whole-genome re-sequencing and genetic mapping we have for the first time molecularly identified the gene responsible for a mutationally defined phenotypic locus in an entomopathogenic nematode. In the process we observed an unexpected mutational spectrum following ethyl methansulfonate mutagenesis in this species. We find that the ortholog of the essential Caenorhabditis elegans peroxidase gene skpo-2 controls body size and shape in S. hermaphroditum. We confirmed this identification by generating additional loss-of-function mutations in the gene using CRISPR-Cas9. We propose that the identification of skpo-2 will accelerate gene targeting in other Steinernema entomopathogenic nematodes used commercially in pest control, as skpo-2 is X-linked and males hemizygous for loss of its function can mate, making skpo-2 an easily recognized and maintained marker for use in co-CRISPR.",38078889

One system of special relevance, due to its economic impacts, is that between Diaphorina citri and 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas), the cause of the severe Asian form of huanglongbing. CLas-positive D.citri are more fecund than their CLas-negative counterparts, boosting opportunities for pathogens to acquire new vector hosts. The molecular mechanism behind this life-history shift remains unclear. Here, we found that CLas promoted ovarian development and increased the expression of the vitellogenin receptor (DcVgR) in ovaries. DcVgR RNAi significantly decreased fecundity and CLas titer in ovaries, extended the preoviposition period, shortened the oviposition period and blocked ovarian development. Given their importance in gene regulation, we explored the role of miRNAs in shaping these phenotypes and their molecular triggers. Our results showed that one miRNA, miR-275, suppressed DcVgR expression by binding to its 3' UTR. Overexpression of miR-275 knocked down DcVgR expression and CLas titer in ovaries, causing reproductive defects that mimicked DcVgR knockdown phenotypes. We focused, further, on roles of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) pathway in shaping the observed fecundity phenotype, given its known impacts on ovarian development. After CLas infection, this pathway was upregulated, thereby increasing DcVgR expression. From these combined results, we conclude that CLas hijacks the JH signalling pathway and miR-275, thereby targeting DcVgR to increase D.citri fecundity. These changes simultaneously increase CLas replication, suggesting a pathogen-vector host mutualism, or a seemingly helpful, but cryptically costly life-history manipulation.",38018658
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""","Diaphorin, a polyketide produced by a bacterial endosymbiont of the Asian citrus psyllid, adversely affects the in vitro gene expression with ribosomes from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.","Diaphorin is a polyketide produced by ""Candidatus Profftella armatura"" (Gammaproteobacteria), an obligate mutualist of an important agricultural pest, the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera). Our previous study demonstrated that diaphorin, at physiological concentrations in D. citri, inhibits the growth and cell division of Bacillus subtilis (Firmicutes) but promotes the growth and metabolic activity of Escherichia coli (Gammaproteobacteria). This unique property of diaphorin may aid microbial mutualism in D. citri, potentially affecting the transmission of ""Candidatus Liberibacter spp."" (Alphaproteobacteria), the pathogens of the most destructive citrus disease Huanglongbing. Moreover, this property may be exploited to promote microbes' efficiency in producing industrial materials. However, the mechanism underlying this activity is unknown. Diaphorin belongs to the family of pederin-type compounds, which inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotes by binding to eukaryotic ribosomes. Therefore, as a first step to assess diaphorin's direct influence on bacterial gene expression, this study examined the effect of diaphorin on the in vitro translation using ribosomes of B. subtilis and E. coli, quantifying the production of the green fluorescent protein. The results showed that the gene expression involving B. subtilis and E. coli ribosomes along with five millimolar diaphorin was 29.6% and 13.1%, respectively, less active than the control. This suggests that the diaphorin's adverse effects on B. subtilis are attributed to, at least partly, its inhibitory effects on gene expression. Moreover, as ingredients of the translation system were common other than ribosomes, the greater inhibitory effects observed with the B. subtilis ribosome imply that the ribosome is among the potential targets of diaphorin. On the other hand, the results also imply that diaphorin's positive effects on E. coli are due to targets other than the core machinery of transcription and translation.

Wolbachia-driven host reproductive manipulations, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), are credited for catapulting these intracellular bacteria to high frequencies in host populations. Positive, perhaps mutualistic, reproductive manipulations also increase infection frequencies, but are not well understood. Here, we identify molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Wolbachia influences the molecularly distinct processes of germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and differentiation. We demonstrate that wMel infection rescues the fertility of flies lacking the translational regulator mei-P26 and is sufficient to sustain infertile homozygous mei-P26-knockdown stocks indefinitely. Cytology revealed that wMel mitigates the impact of mei-P26 loss through restoring proper pMad, Bam, Sxl, and Orb expression. In Oregon R files with wild-type fertility, wMel infection elevates lifetime egg hatch rates. Exploring these phenotypes through dual-RNAseq quantification of eukaryotic and bacterial transcripts revealed that wMel infection rescues and offsets many gene expression changes induced by mei-P26 loss at the mRNA level. Overall, we show that wMel infection beneficially reinforces host fertility at mRNA, protein, and phenotypic levels, and these mechanisms may promote the emergence of mutualism and the breakdown of host reproductive manipulations.",37874788
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Mutualism reduces the severity of gene disruptions in predictable ways across microbial communities.,"Predicting evolution in microbial communities is critical for problems from human health to global nutrient cycling. Understanding how species interactions impact the distribution of fitness effects for a focal population would enhance our ability to predict evolution. Specifically, does the type of ecological interaction, such as mutualism or competition, change the average effect of a mutation (i.e., the mean of the distribution of fitness effects)? Furthermore, how often does increasing community complexity alter the impact of species interactions on mutant fitness? To address these questions, we created a transposon mutant library in Salmonella enterica and measured the fitness of loss of function mutations in 3,550 genes when grown alone versus competitive co-culture or mutualistic co-culture with Escherichia coli and Methylorubrum extorquens. We found that mutualism reduces the average impact of mutations, while competition had no effect. Additionally, mutant fitness in the 3-species communities can be predicted by averaging the fitness in each 2-species community. Finally, we discovered that in the mutualism S. enterica obtained vitamins and more amino acids than previously known. Our results suggest that species interactions can predictably impact fitness effect distributions, in turn suggesting that evolution may ultimately be predictable in multi-species communities.",37865718
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Genes possibly related to symbiosis in early life stages of Acropora tenuis inoculated with Symbiodinium microadriaticum.,"Due to the ecological importance of mutualism between reef-building corals and symbiotic algae (Family Symbiodiniaceae), various transcriptomic studies on coral-algal symbiosis have been performed; however, molecular mechanisms, especially genes essential to initiate and maintain these symbioses remain unknown. We investigated transcriptomic responses of Acropora tenuis to inoculation with the native algal symbiont, Symbiodinium microadriaticum, during early life stages, and identified possible symbiosis-related genes. Genes involved in immune regulation, protection against oxidative stress, and metabolic interactions between partners are particularly important for symbiosis during Acropora early life stages. In addition, molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that some possible symbiosis-related genes originated by gene duplication in the Acropora lineage, suggesting that gene duplication may have been the driving force to establish stable mutualism in Acropora, and that symbiotic molecular mechanisms may vary among coral lineages.",37853100

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""","Ancestry testing of ""Old Tom,"" a killer whale central to mutualistic interactions with human whalers.","Cooperative hunting between humans and killer whales (Orcinus orca) targeting baleen whales was reported in Eden, New South Wales, Australia, for almost a century. By 1928, whaling operations had ceased, and local killer whale sightings became scarce. A killer whale from the group, known as ""Old Tom,"" washed up dead in 1930 and his skeleton was preserved. How these killer whales from Eden relate to other populations globally and whether their genetic descendants persist today remains unknown. We extracted and sequenced DNA from Old Tom using ancient DNA techniques. Genomic sequences were then compared with a global dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Old Tom shared a most recent common ancestor with killer whales from Australasia, the North Atlantic, and the North Pacific, having the highest genetic similarity with contemporary New Zealand killer whales. However, much of the variation found in Old Tom's genome was not shared with these widespread populations, suggesting ancestral rather than ongoing gene flow. Our genetic comparisons also failed to find any clear descendants of Tom, raising the possibility of local extinction of this group. We integrated Traditional Custodian knowledge to recapture the events in Eden and recognize that Indigenous Australians initiated the relationship with the killer whales before European colonization and the advent of commercial whaling locally. This study rectifies discrepancies in local records and provides new insight into the origins of the killer whales in Eden and the history of Australasian killer whales.",37821799
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Fungal community inside lichen: a curious case of sparse diversity and high modularity.,"Lichens represent not only the mutualism of fungal and photosynthetic partners but also are composed of microbial consortium harboring diverse fungi known as endolichenic fungi. While endolichenic fungi are known to exert a remarkable influence on lichen ecology through their crucial roles in nutrient cycling, bioprospecting and biodiversity, the enigmatic community structures of these fungal inhabitants remain shrouded in mystery, awaiting further exploration and discovery. To address knowledge gap, we conducted metabarcoding on two lichens using 18S gene amplification, Dirinara applanta and Parmotrema tinctorum, and compared their microbial communities to those found in the pine bark to which the lichens were attached. Our hypothesis was that the endolichenic communities would exhibit distinct diversity patterns, community structures, network structures, and specialist composition compared to the surrounding epiphytic community. Our investigation has shed light on the clear demarcation between the endolichenic and epiphytic fungal communities, as they exhibit markedly different characteristics that set them apart from each other. This research demonstrated that the endolichenic communities are less diverse as compared to the epiphytic communities. Through community similarity analysis, we observed that two endolichenic communities are more similar to each other in terms of community composition than with the adjacent epiphytic communities. Moreover, we unveiled a striking contrast in the network structures between the endolichenic and epiphytic communities, as the former displayed a more modular and less nested features that is evocative of a potent host-filtration mechanism. Through our investigation, we have discovered that lichens harbor less intricate and interconnected fungal communities compared to the neighboring epiphytic environment. These observations provide valuable insights into the metagenomic architecture of lichens and offer a tantalizing glimpse into the unique mycobiome.",37789449
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Paired growth of cultivated and halophytic wild rice under salt stress induces bacterial endophytes and gene expression responses.,"Utilizing salt-affected marginal lands in coastal regions can help meet the growing demand for rice. We explored a nature-based solution involving wild halophytic rice (<i>O. coarctata, Oc</i>) and commercial rice BRRI Dhan 67 (<i>O. sativa, Os</i>) grown in close proximity to each other under salt stress. This was to investigate whether a paired planting strategy could help complement rice growth and yield under stress. We also investigated the gene expression and endophytic bacterial profiles of both <i>Os and Oc</i> in unpaired and paired conditions without and with salt. Paired plants exhibited lower salt damage indicators such as smaller reduction in plant height, electrolyte leakage and chlorophyll loss, as well as higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio under saline stress. Some of the 39 endophytic bacteria in the mutualism experiment were unique to <i>Oc</i> and transferred to <i>Os</i> when paired. Differentially expressed genes in leaves of paired <i>Os</i> versus unpaired <i>Os</i> were 1097 (994 up-regulated, 101 down-regulated) without salt and 893 (763 up-regulated, 130 down-regulated) under salt stress. The presence of <i>Oc</i> plants under salt stress influenced major biological processes in <i>Os</i>, including oxidative stress; chitinase activity; phenylalanine catabolic process and response to ABA. Protein binding and serine/threonine kinase activity were primarily affected in molecular function. The downregulated WRKY transcription factor 22 in paired conditions under salt stress played a role in the MAPK signaling pathway, reducing respiratory cell death. The upregulated auxin-responsive protein IAA18 gene, involved in hormone signaling and cell enlargement, was present only in paired plants. Our findings therefore, offer insights into developing more effective cultivation strategies for sustainable rice production.",37746015
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",The genetic structuring in pollinating wasps of <i>Ficus hispida</i> in continental Asia.,"The interaction between figs and fig wasps provides a striking example of obligate brood site pollination mutualism. Monoecious figs, constituting independent radiations in each tropical biome, are present in significant proportions worldwide, but in continental Asia, dioecious figs have diverged into various niches, making the region's assemblage remarkably diverse. However, the reproductive success of figs and fig wasps largely depends on the fig wasp dispersal process. Monoecious fig pollinators in continental Asian tropical rain forests exhibit high gene flow of the plant, while many dioecious fig pollinators have a more restricted gene flow. However, there are limited studies on the genetic structure of dioecious <i>Ficus</i> pollinators that pollinate figs with intermediate gene flow. Here, we used molecular methods to investigate the genetic structure of pollinating wasps of the widely distributed dioecious <i>Ficus hispida</i> in China and Southeast Asia. Sequence data from two gene regions were used: the mitochondrial protein-coding gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the nuclear 28S genes. Both molecular and morphological results support two fig wasp species at our sampling sites. Our findings suggest that for widely sympatric <i>Ficus</i> species in continental Asia, monoecious figs presenting long gene glow have the fewest fig wasp species, followed by dioecious figs presenting intermediate gene flow, and dioecious figs presenting local gene flow have the most fig wasp species.",37745788
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Cryptic community structure and metabolic interactions among the heritable facultative symbionts of the pea aphid.,"Most insects harbour influential, yet non-essential heritable microbes in their hemocoel. Communities of these symbionts exhibit low diversity. But their frequent multi-species nature raises intriguing questions on roles for symbiont-symbiont synergies in host adaptation, and on the stability of the symbiont communities, themselves. In this study, we build on knowledge of species-defined symbiont community structure across US populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Through extensive symbiont genotyping, we show that pea aphids' microbiomes can be more precisely defined at the symbiont strain level, with strain variability shaping five out of nine previously reported co-infection trends. Field data provide a mixture of evidence for synergistic fitness effects and symbiont hitchhiking, revealing causes and consequences of these co-infection trends. To test whether within-host metabolic interactions predict common versus rare strain-defined communities, we leveraged the high relatedness of our dominant, community-defined symbiont strains vs. 12 pea aphid-derived Gammaproteobacteria with sequenced genomes. Genomic inference, using metabolic complementarity indices, revealed high potential for cooperation among one pair of symbionts-Serratia symbiotica and Rickettsiella viridis. Applying the expansion network algorithm, through additional use of pea aphid and obligate Buchnera symbiont genomes, Serratia and Rickettsiella emerged as the only symbiont community requiring both parties to expand holobiont metabolism. Through their joint expansion of the biotin biosynthesis pathway, these symbionts may span missing gaps, creating a multi-party mutualism within their nutrient-limited, phloem-feeding hosts. Recent, complementary gene inactivation, within the biotin pathways of Serratia and Rickettsiella, raises further questions on the origins of mutualisms and host-symbiont interdependencies.",37702036

Besides mutualism, bacteria have evolved a variety of molecular-based anti-algal strategies. However, limited by the unknown mechanism of synthesis and action of these molecules, these strategies and their global prevalence remain unknown. Here we identify a novel strategy through which a marine representative of the Gammaproteobacteria produced 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol (4-BP), that kills or inhibits diverse phytoplankton by inhibiting plastoquinone synthesis and its effect cascades to many other key metabolic processes of the algae. Through comparative genomic analysis between the 4-BP-producing bacterium and its algicidally inactive mutant, combined with gene function verification, we identified the gene cluster responsible for 4-BP synthesis, which contains genes encoding chorismate lyase, flavin-dependent halogenase and cytochrome P450. We demonstrated that in near in situ simulated algal blooming seawater, even low concentrations of 4-BP can cause changes in overall phytoplankton community structure with a decline in dinoflagellates and diatoms. Further analyses of the gene sequences from the Tara Oceans expeditions and 2750 whole genome sequences confirmed the ubiquitous presence of 4-BP synthetic genes in diverse bacterial members in the global ocean, suggesting that it is a bacterial tool potentially widely used in global oceans to mediate bacteria-algae antagonistic relationships.",37679430

In this study, we examined the effect of <i>S. indica</i> colonization on herbivore (<i>Spodoptera exigua</i>) resistance of onion (<i>Allium cepa</i> L.). We found that colonization of <i>S. indica</i> in the roots of onion significantly reduced the feeding damage of leaves by <i>S. exigua</i> larvae, and also resulted in a reduction in weight gain of the larvae when fed on <i>S. indica</i> plants. This enhanced resistance is a result of modulation of antioxidant and defense enzymes/genes in the host by <i>S. indica</i> mutualism.

Similarly, defense genes also showed modulation in response to this tripartite interaction of onion -<i>S. indica</i> mutualism and <i>S. exigua</i> herbivory. The hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis indicated a clear difference in the onion biochemical responses, which is due to the <i>S. indica</i> symbiosis.

These fungi have long been presumed saprobic due to their occurrence in or near leaf litter and soils. Additionally, they lack an apparent association with other organisms, reinforcing this perception. However, observations of sporocarps near ericaceous shrubs have given rise to an alternative hypothesis that members of Geoglossomycetes may form ericoid mycorrhizae or ectomycorrhizae. This claim, however, has yet to be confirmed via microscopy or amplicon-based studies examining root communities. As a result, our current understanding of their ecology is based on cursory observations. This study presents a comparative analysis of genomic signatures related to ecological niche to investigate the hypothesis of an ericoid mycorrhizal or ectomycorrhizal ecology in the class. We compared the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) and secondary metabolite contents of six newly sequenced Geoglossomycetes genomes with those of fungi representing specific ecologies across Pezizomycotina.

However, it is challenging to quantify this kind of contribution due to the lack of appropriate genetic markers and the associated controllable environmental factors. Here, based on the unique transformable nature of arsenic (the controllable environmental factor), a series of flooding microcosms was established to investigate the contribution of arsM-bearing lysogenic phages to their hosts' adaptation to trivalent arsenic [As(III)] toxicity, where arsM is the marker gene associated with microbial As(III) detoxification. In the 15-day flooding period, the concentration of As(III) was significantly increased, and this elevated As(III) toxicity visibly inhibited the bacterial population, but the latter quickly adapted to As(III) toxicity. During the flooding period, some lysogenic phages re-infected new hosts after an early burst, while others persistently followed the productive cycle (i.e., lytic cycle). The unique phage-host interplay contributed to the rapid spread of arsM among soil microbiota, enabling the quick recovery of the bacterial community. Moreover, the higher abundance of arsM imparted a greater arsenic methylation capability to soil microbiota. Collectively, this study provides experimental evidence for lysogenic phages assisting their hosts in adapting to an extreme environment, which highlights the ecological perspectives on lysogenic phage-host mutualism.",37161002

Corals can acquire photosynthates from Symbiodiniaceae, whilst Symbiodiniaceae uses metabolites from corals. Prokaryotic microbes provide Symbiodiniaceae with nutrients and support the resilience of corals as meta-organisms. Eutrophication is a major cause of coral reef degradation; however, its effects on the transcriptomic response of coral meta-organisms remain unclear, particularly for prokaryotic microbes associated with corals in the larval stage. To understandacclimation of the coral meta-organism to elevated nitrate conditions,we analyzed the physiological and transcriptomic responses of Pocillopora damicornis larvae, an ecologically important scleractinian coral, after 5days of exposure to elevated nitrate levels (5, 10, 20, and 40M). The major differentially expressed transcripts in coral, Symbiodiniaceae, and prokaryotic microbes included thoserelated to development, stress response, and transport. The development of Symbiodiniaceae was not affected in the 5 and 20M groups but was downregulated in the 10 and 40M groups. In contrast, prokaryotic microbe development was upregulated in the 10 and 40M groups and downregulated in the 5 and 20M groups. Meanwhile, coral larval development was less downregulated in the 10 and 40M groups than in the 5 and 20M groups. In addition, multiple larval, Symbiodiniaceae, and prokaryotic transcripts were significantly correlated with each other. The core transcripts in correlation networks were related to development, nutrient metabolism, and transport. A generalized linear mixed model, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, demonstrated that the Symbiodiniaceae could both benefit and cost coral larval development. Furthermore, the most significantly correlated prokaryotic transcripts maintained negative correlations with the physiological functions of Symbiodiniaceae. Results suggested that Symbiodiniaceae tended to retain more nutrients under elevated nitrate concentrations, thereby shifting the coral-algal association from mutualism towards parasitism. Prokaryotic microbes provided Symbiodiniaceae with essential nutrients and may control Symbiodiniaceae growth through competition, whereby prokaryotes can also restore coral larval development inhibited by Symbiodiniaceae overgrowth.

The number of T6SS loci encoded in Xenorhabdus genomes are variable both at the inter and intraspecific level. Some environmental isolates of Xenorhabdus bovienii, encode at least one T6SS locus while others possess two loci. Previous work conducted by our team demonstrated that X. bovienii [Jollieti strain SS-2004], which has two T6SSs (T6SS-1 and T6SS-2), hcp genes are required for biofilm formation. Additionally, while T6SS-1 hcp gene plays a role in the antibacterial competition, T6SS-2 hcp does not. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that vgrG genes are also involved in mutualistic and pathogenic interactions. For this purpose, targeted mutagenesis together with wet lab experiments including colonization, competition, biofilm, and virulence experiments, were carried out to assess the role of vgrG in the mutualistic and antagonistic interactions in the life cycle of XBJ. Our results revealed that vgrG genes are not required for biofilm formation but play a role in outcompeting other Xenorhabdus bacteria.

This manifestation of mutualism between fucotrophic bacteria and the mature host utilizes a sentinel receptor in the intestinal mucosa; this receptor was isolated to distinguish its structural and functional features. Provisional identification of the sentinel gut receptor as fuc-TLR4 was through colonization of germ-free mutant mice. Conventional mice whose microbiota was depleted with a cocktail of antibiotics were used to further define the nature and functions of fuc-TLR4 sentinel, and to define the role of the fucotrophic microbiota in gut homeostasis and recovery from insult. The nature of the sentinel was confirmed in cultured human HEL cells. Fuc-TLR4 activity is distinct from that of TLR4. Activated mucosal fuc-TLR4 induces a fuc-TLR4 dependent non-inflammatory (ERK and JNK dependent, NF-B independent) signaling cascade, initiating induction of fucosyltransferase 2 (secretor) gene transcription. <i>In vitro</i>, either defucosylation or TLR4 knockdown abrogates <i>FUT2</i> induction, indicating that fuc-TLR4 activity requires both the peptide and glycan moieties. <i>In vivo</i>, fucose-utilizing bacteria and fucose-binding ligands induce mucosal fucosylation. Activation of this pathway is essential for recovery from chemically induced mucosal injury <i>in vivo</i>. In mature mice, fucosyl-TLR4 mediated gut fucosylation creates a niche that supports the healthy fucose-dependent mutualism between the mammalian gut and its fucotrophic microbes. Such microbiota-induced Fuc-TLR4 signaling supports initial colonization of the secretor gut, recovery from dysbiosis, and restoration or preservation of intestinal homeostasis.",37007789
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Comparative transcriptomics of aphid species that diverged >22 MYA reveals genes that are important for the maintenance of their symbiosis.,"Most plant-sap feeding insects have obligate relationships with maternally transmitted bacteria. Aphids require their nutritional endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, for the production of essential amino acids. Such endosymbionts are harbored inside of specialized insect cells called bacteriocytes. Here, we use comparative transcriptomics of bacteriocytes between two recently diverged aphid species, Myzus persicae and Acyrthosiphon pisum, to identify key genes that are important for the maintenance of their nutritional mutualism. The majority of genes with conserved expression profiles in M. persicae and A. pisum are for orthologs previously identified in A. pisum to be important for the symbiosis. However, asparaginase which produces aspartate from asparagine was significantly up-regulated only in A. pisum bacteriocytes, potentially because Buchnera of M. persicae encodes its own asparaginase enzyme unlike Buchnera of A. pisum resulting in Buchnera of A. pisum to be dependent on its aphid host for aspartate. One-to-one orthologs that explained the most amount of variation for bacteriocyte specific mRNA expression for both species includes a collaborative gene for methionine biosynthesis, multiple transporters, a horizontally transmitted gene, and secreted proteins. Finally, we highlight species-specific gene clusters which may contribute to host adaptations and/or accommodations in gene regulation to changes in the symbiont or the symbiosis.",37005434
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",A genetic linkage map and improved genome assembly of the termite symbiont Termitomyces cryptogamus.,"The termite-fungussymbiosis is an ancient stable mutualism of two partners that reproduce and disperse independently. With the founding of each termite colony the symbiotic association must be re-established with a new fungus partner. Complementarity in the ability to break down plant substrate may help to stabilize this symbiosis despite horizontal symbiont transmission. An alternative, non-exclusive, hypothesis is that a reduced rate of evolution may contribute to stabilize the symbiosis, the so-called Red King Effect. To explore this concept, we produced the first linkage map of a species of Termitomyces, using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of 88 homokaryotic offspring. We constructed a highly contiguous genome assembly using PacBio data and a de-novo evidence-based annotation. This improved genome assembly and linkage map allowed for examination of the recombination landscape and its potential effect on the mutualistic lifestyle. Our linkage map resulted in a genome-wide recombination rate of 22cM/Mb, lower than that of other related fungi. However, the total map length of 1370cM was similar to that of other related fungi. The apparently decreased rate of recombination is primarily due to genome expansion of islands of gene-poor repetitive sequences. This study highlights the importance of inclusion of genomic context in cross-species comparisons of recombination rate.",36927388

This pest has evolved a special proto-farming bipartite mutualism with the fungus <i>Penicillium herquei</i>, which provide nutrition and defensive protection for the <i>E. chinensis</i> larvae. Here, the genome of <i>P. herquei</i> was sequenced, and the structure and specific gene categories in the <i>P. herquei</i> genome were then comprehensively compared with the other two well-studied <i>Penicillium</i> species (<i>P. decumbens</i> and <i>P. chrysogenum</i>). The assembled <i>P. herquei</i> genome had a 40.25 Mb genome size with 46.7% GC content. A diverse set of genes associating with carbohydrate-active enzymes, cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, transporter, and terpenoid biosynthesis were detected in the <i>P. herquei</i> genome. Comparative genomics demonstrate that the three <i>Penicillium</i> species show similar metabolic and enzymatic potential, however, <i>P. herquei</i> has more genes associated with plant biomass degradation and defense but less genes associating with virulence pathogenicity. Our results provide molecular evidence for plant substrate breakdown and protective roles of <i>P. herquei</i> in <i>E. chinensis</i> mutualistic system.

To explore blumenol function in AMF relationships, we silenced an early key-gene in blumenol biosynthesis, CCD1 (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1), in the ecological model plant, Nicotiana attenuata, and analyzed whole-plant performance in comparison with control and CCaMK-silenced plants, unable to form AMF associations. Root blumenol accumulations reflected a plant's Darwinian fitness, as estimated by capsule production, and were positively correlated with AMF-specific lipid accumulations in roots, with relationships that changed as plants matured when grown without competitors. When grown with wild-type competitors, transformed plants with decreased photosynthetic capacity or increased carbon flux to roots had blumenol accumulations that predicted plant fitness and genotype trends in AMF-specific lipids, but had similar levels of AMF-specific lipids between competing plants, likely reflecting AMF-networks. We propose that when grown in isolation, blumenol accumulations reflect AMF-specific lipid allocations and plant fitness. When grown with competitors, blumenol accumulations predict fitness outcomes, but not the more complicated AMF-specific lipid accumulations. RNA-seq analysis provided candidates for the final biosynthetic steps of these AMF-indicative blumenol C-glucosides; abrogation of these steps will provide valuable tools for understanding blumenol function in this context-dependent mutualism.",36866959

Wolbachia supergroup F is a particularly interesting clade as it gave rise to symbionts of both arthropods and nematodes, and some of its members are obligate mutualists. Investigations on evolutionary transitions among the different symbiotic stages have been hampered by a lack of the known diversity and genomic data for the supergroup F members. Based on amplicon screening, short- and long-read WGS approaches, and laser confocal microscopy, we characterize five new supergroup F Wolbachia strains from four chewing lice species. These strains reached different evolutionary stages and represent two remarkably different types of symbiont genomes. Three of the genomes resemble other known members of Wolbachia F supergroup, while the other two show typical signs of ongoing gene inactivation and removal (genome size, coding density, low number of pseudogenes). Particularly, wMeur1, a symbiont fixed in microbiomes of Menacanthus eurysternus across four continents, possesses a highly reduced genome of 733,850bp. The horizontally acquired capacity for pantothenate synthesis and localization in specialized bacteriocytes suggest its obligate nutritional role. The genome of wMeur1 strain, from the M. eurysternus microbiome, represents the smallest currently known Wolbachia genome and the first example of Wolbachia which has completed genomic streamlining as known from the typical obligate symbionts. This points out that despite the large amount and great diversity of the known Wolbachia strains, evolutionary potential of these bacteria still remains underexplored. The diversity of the four chewing lice microbiomes indicates that this vast parasitic group may provide suitable models for further investigations. Video Abstract.",36750860

Intriguingly, the endofungal bacteria are essential for the propagation of the fungal host. Yet, little is known about chemical mediators fostering the symbiosis, and universal metabolites that support the mutualistic relationship have remained elusive. Here, we describe the discovery of a complex of specialized metabolites produced by endofungal bacteria under symbiotic conditions. Through full genome sequencing and comparative genomics of eight endofungal symbiont strains from geographically distant regions, we discovered a conserved gene locus (<i>hab</i>) for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase as a unifying trait. Bioinformatics analyses, targeted gene deletions, and chemical profiling uncovered unprecedented depsipeptides (habitasporins) whose structures were fully elucidated. Computational network analysis and labeling experiments granted insight into the biosynthesis of their nonproteinogenic building blocks (pipecolic acid and -phenylalanine). Deletion of the <i>hab</i> gene locus was shown to impair the ability of the bacteria to enter their fungal host. Our study unveils a common principle of the endosymbiotic lifestyle of <i>Mycetohabitans</i> species and expands the repertoire of characterized chemical mediators of a globally occurring mutualistic association.",36714835
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",STING Promotes Intestinal IgA Production by Regulating Acetate-producing Bacteria to Maintain Host-microbiota Mutualism.,"Intestinal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is crucial in maintaining host-microbiota mutualism and gut homeostasis. It has been shown that many species of gut bacteria produce cyclic dinucleotides, along with an abundance of microbiota-derived DNA present within the intestinal lumen, which triggers the tonic activation of the cytosolic cGAS-STING pathway. However, the role of STING in intestinal IgA remains poorly understood. We further investigated whether and how STING affects intestinal IgA response. Intestinal IgA was determined between wild-type (WT) mice and Sting-/- mice in steady conditions and upon enteric Citrobacter rodentium infection. STING agonists were used to stimulating B cells or dendritic cells in vitro. Gut microbiota composition was examined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Bacteria metabolomics functional analyses was performed by PICRUSt2. Fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) was determined by Mass spectrometry and Cedex Bio Analyzer. Gut bacteria from WT mice and Sting-/- mice were transferred into germ-free mice and antibiotic-pretreated mice. Intestinal IgA response was impaired in Sting-/- mice. However, STING agonists did not directly stimulate B cells or dendritic cells to induce IgA. Interestingly, Sting-/- mice displayed altered gut microbiota composition with decreased SCFA-producing bacteria and downregulated SCFA fermentation pathways. Transfer of fecal bacteria from Sting-/- mice induced less IgA than that from WT mice in germ-free mice and antibiotic-pretreated mice, which is mediated by GPR43. Acetate, the dominant SCFA, was decreased in Sting-/- mice, and supplementation of acetate restored intestinal IgA production in Sting-/- mice. STING promotes intestinal IgA by regulating acetate-producing gut bacteria.",36661414
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution in wild animals and plants.,"Wild animals and plants have developed a variety of adaptive traits driven by adaptive evolution, an important strategy for species survival and persistence. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution is the key to understanding species diversification, phenotypic convergence, and inter-species interaction. As the genome sequences of more and more non-model organisms are becoming available, the focus of studies on molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution has shifted from the candidate gene method to genetic mapping based on genome-wide scanning. In this study, we reviewed the latest research advances in wild animals and plants, focusing on adaptive traits, convergent evolution, and coevolution. Firstly, we focused on the adaptive evolution of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits. Secondly, we reviewed the phenotypic convergences of life history traits and responding to environmental pressures, and the underlying molecular convergence mechanisms. Thirdly, we summarized the advances of coevolution, including the four main types: mutualism, parasitism, predation and competition. Overall, these latest advances greatly increase our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms for diverse adaptive traits and species interaction, demonstrating that the development of evolutionary biology has been greatly accelerated by multi-omics technologies. Finally, we highlighted the emerging trends and future prospects around the above three aspects of adaptive evolution.",36648611

Here, we investigated the functions of AreA in the fungal entomopathogen and plant endophyte <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> using knockdown of gene expression. The <i>antiAreA</i> mutants were impaired in nitrogen utilization and showed increased sensitivities to osmotic stressors but increased tolerances to oxidative/hypoxia stresses. Repression of <i>BbAreA</i> caused overall minimal effects on fungal virulence. The minor effects on virulence appeared to be due in part to competing secondary effects where host defense phenoloxidase activity was significantly decreased, but production of the fungal metabolite oosporein was increased and hyphal body development was impaired. Knockdown of <i>BbAreA</i> expression also resulted in impairment in ability of the fungus to associate with host plants. These data implicate that BbAreA likely acts as a regulator to balance fungal nutrient utilization, pathogenicity, and mutualism, facilitating the fungal occupation of host niches.",36584226
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",A beneficial fungal root endophyte triggers systemic RNA silencing and DNA methylation of a host reporter gene.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that RNA interference (RNAi) plays a pivotal role in the communication between plants and pathogenic fungi, where a bi-directional trans-kingdom RNAi is established to the advantage of either the host or the pathogen. Similar mechanisms acting during plant association with non-pathogenic symbiotic microorganisms have been elusive to this date. To determine whether root endophytes can induce systemic RNAi responses to their host plants, we designed an experimental reporter-based system consisting of the root-restricted, beneficial fungal endophyte, <i>Fusarium solani</i> strain K (FsK) and its host <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Since not all fungi encode the RNAi machinery, we first needed to validate that FsK does so, by identifying its core RNAi enzymes (2 Dicer-like genes, 2 Argonautes and 4 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) and by showing its susceptibility to <i>in vitro</i> RNAi upon exogenous application of double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Upon establishing this, we transformed FsK with a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) construct designed to target a reporter gene in its host <i>N. benthamiana</i>. The hpRNA was processed by FsK RNAi machinery predominantly into 21-24-nt small RNAs that triggered RNA silencing but not DNA methylation in the fungal hyphae. Importantly, when the hpRNA-expressing FsK was used to inoculate <i>N. benthamiana</i>, systemic RNA silencing and DNA methylation of the host reporter gene was recorded.

The comparison between annual and perennial sweet sorghum cultivars in terms of plant growth, as well as their interactions with belowground fungal microbiota, is still poorly understood, although there has been growing interest in the mutualism between annual sweet sorghum and soil bacteria or bacterial endophytes. In this study, the perennial sweet sorghum cultivar N778 (N778 simply) and its control lines TP213 and TP60 were designed to grow under natural field conditions. Bulk soil, rhizosphere soil and sorghum roots were collected at the blooming and maturity stages, and then the fungal microbiota of those samples were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS1 amplicon. Our results revealed that the alpha diversity of the fungal microbiota in rhizosphere soil and root samples was significantly different between N778 and the two control lines TP213 and TP60 at the blooming or maturity stage. Moreover, beta diversity in rhizosphere soil of N778 was distinct from those of TP213 and TP60, while beta diversity in root samples of N778 was distinct from those of TP213 but not TP60 by PCoA based on Bray-Curtis and WUF distance metrics. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multiple group comparisons revealed that OTU4372, a completely unclassified taxon but with symbiotroph mode, was enriched in sorghum roots, especially in N778 aerial roots at the blooming stage. Our results indicate that <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Alternaria</i>, two fungal genera in the rhizosphere soil, may also be dominant indicators of sorghum yield and protein content in addition to <i>Fusarium</i> at the maturity stage and imply that the perennial sweet sorghum N778 can primarily recruit dominant psychrotolerant bacterial taxa but not dominant cold-tolerant fungal taxa into its rhizosphere to support its survival below the freezing point.",36386674

The bacteria encounter DNA-rich mucus throughout their transition to a symbiotic lifestyle, leading us to hypothesize a role for nuclease activity in the colonization process. In support of this, we detected abundant extracellular nuclease activity in growing cells of V. fischeri. To discover the gene(s) responsible for this activity, we screened a V. fischeri transposon mutant library for nuclease-deficient strains. Interestingly, only one strain, whose transposon insertion mapped to nuclease gene <i>VF_1451</i>, showed complete loss of nuclease activity in our screens. A database search revealed that <i>VF_1451</i> is homologous to the nuclease-encoding gene <i>xds</i> in Vibrio cholerae. However, V. fischeri strains lacking <i>xds</i> eventually revealed slight nuclease activity on plates after 72h. This led us to hypothesize that a second secreted nuclease, identified through a database search as <i>VF_0437</i>, a homolog of V. cholerae <i>dns</i>, might be responsible for the residual nuclease activity. Here, we show that Xds and/or Dns are involved in essential aspects of V. fischeri biology, including natural transformation, aggregation, and phosphate scavenging. Furthermore, strains lacking either nuclease were outcompeted by the wild type for squid colonization. Understanding the specific role of nuclease activity in the squid colonization process represents an intriguing area of future research. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> From soil and water to host-associated secretions such as mucus, environments that bacteria inhabit are awash in DNA. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a nutritious resource that microbes dedicate significant energy to exploit. Calcium binds eDNA to promote cell-cell aggregation and horizontal gene transfer. eDNA hydrolysis impacts construction of and dispersal from biofilms. Strategies in which pathogens use nucleases to avoid phagocytosis or disseminate by degrading host secretions are well documented; significantly less is known about nucleases in mutualistic associations. This study describes the role of nucleases in the mutualism between V. fischeri and its squid host, Euprymna scolopes. We find that nuclease activity is an important determinant of colonization in V. fischeri, broadening our understanding of how microbes establish and maintain beneficial associations.",36342139

We used transcriptome sequences of 25 fig wasps in six genera that allowed a comparative approach to the evolution of key molecular components of fig wasp chemoreception: their odorant (OR) and gustatory (GR) receptor genes. In total, we identified 311 ORs and 47 GRs, with each species recording from 5 to 30 OR genes and 1-4 GR genes. 304 OR genes clustered into 18 orthologous groups known to be sensitive to cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC), pheromones, acids, alcohols and a variety of floral scents such as cineole, Linalool, and Heptanone. 45 GR genes clustered into 4 orthologous groups that contain sweet, bitter, CO<sub>2</sub> and undocumented receptors. Gene sequences in most orthologous groups varied greatly among species, except for ORco (60.0% conserved) and sweet receptors (30.7% conserved). Strong purifying selection of both odorant and gustatory genes was detected, as shown by low  values. Signatures of positive selection were detected in loci from both OR and GR orthologous groups. Fig wasps have relatively few olfactory and especially gustatory receptors, reflecting the natural history of the system. Amino acid sequences nonetheless vary significantly between species and are consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among fig wasps. The differences in ORs within some orthologous groups from the same species, but different hosts and from closely related species from one host can reach as low as 49.3% and 9.8% respectively, implying the ORs of fig wasps can evolve rapidly to novel ecological environments.

Here, we investigated a symbiotic relationship involving the mulberry seed bug Paradieuches dissimilis (Lygaeoidea: Rhyparochromidae) using histological observations, cultivation of the symbiont, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and infection testing of cultured symbionts. Histological observations and cultivation revealed that P. dissimilis harbors Caballeronia symbionts in the crypts of its posterior midgut. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of field-collected P. dissimilis confirmed that the genus Caballeronia is dominant in the midgut of natural populations of P. dissimilis. In addition, PCR diagnostics showed that the eggs were free of symbiotic bacteria, and hatchlings horizontally acquired the symbionts from ambient soil. Infection and rearing experiments revealed that symbiont-free aposymbiotic individuals had abnormal body color, small body size, and, strikingly, a low survival rate, wherein no individuals reached adulthood, indicating an obligate cooperative mutualism between the mulberry seed bug and Caballeronia symbionts.",36178538
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Discordant population structure among rhizobium divided genomes and their legume hosts.,"Symbiosis often occurs between partners with distinct life history characteristics and dispersal mechanisms. Many bacterial symbionts have genomes comprising multiple replicons with distinct rates of evolution and horizontal transmission. Such differences might drive differences in population structure between hosts and symbionts and among the elements of the divided genomes of bacterial symbionts. These differences might, in turn, shape the evolution of symbiotic interactions and bacterial evolution. Here we use whole genome resequencing of a hierarchically structured sample of 191 strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti collected from 21 locations in southern Europe to characterize population structures of this bacterial symbiont, which forms a root nodule symbiosis with the host plant Medicago truncatula. S. meliloti genomes showed high local (within-site) variation and little isolation by distance. This was particularly true for the two symbiosis elements, pSymA and pSymB, which have population structures that are similar to each other, but distinct from both the bacterial chromosome and the host plant. Given limited recombination on the chromosome, compared to the symbiosis elements, distinct population structures may result from differences in effective gene flow. Alternatively, positive or purifying selection, with little recombination, may explain distinct geographical patterns at the chromosome. Discordant population structure between hosts and symbionts indicates that geographically and genetically distinct host populations in different parts of the range might interact with genetically similar symbionts, potentially minimizing local specialization.",36161739

Here, we demonstrate that IgA responses are subject to diurnal regulation over the course of a circadian day. Specifically, the magnitude of IgA secretion, as well as the transcriptome of intestinal IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells, was found to exhibit rhythmicity. Oscillatory IgA responses were found to be entrained by time of feeding and were also found to be in part coordinated by the plasma cell-intrinsic circadian clock via deletion of the master clock gene <i>Arntl</i>. Moreover, reciprocal interactions between the host and microbiota dictated oscillatory dynamics among the commensal microbial community and its associated transcriptional and metabolic activity in an IgA-dependent manner.

Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors. The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.",35982413

In the present study, FBA predicted a set of gene deletions (pykA, pykF, ppc, zwf, and adhE) that leads to growth-associated phenylalanine production in Escherichia coli. The knockout strain is theoretically enforced to produce phenylalanine only at high growth yields, and could not be applied to the ALE experiment because of a severe growth defect. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach for ALE based on mutualistic co-culture for coupling growth and production, regardless of the growth rate. We designed a synthetic mutualism of a phenylalanine-producing leucine-auxotrophic strain (KF strain) and a leucine-producing phenylalanine-auxotrophic strain (KL strain) and performed an ALE experiment for approximately 160 generations. The evolved KF strain (KF-E strain) grew in a synthetic medium (with glucose as the main carbon source) supplemented with leucine, while severe growth defects were observed in the parental KF strain.

Comparison with 54 Rhizobiales genomes showed that all insect-associated Rhizobiales lost the ability to fix nitrogen and that the Acromyrmex symbionts had exceptionally also lost the urease genes. However, the Acromyrmex strains share biosynthesis pathways for riboflavin vitamin, queuosine and a wide range of antioxidant enzymes likely to be beneficial for the ant fungus-farming symbiosis. We infer that the Rhizobiales symbionts catabolize excess of fungus-garden-derived arginine to urea, supplementing complementary Mollicutes symbionts that turn arginine into ammonia and infer that these combined symbiont activities stabilize the fungus-farming mutualism. Similar to the Mollicutes symbionts, the Rhizobiales species have fully functional CRISPR/Cas and R-M phage defenses, suggesting that these symbionts are important enough for the ant hosts to have precluded the evolution of metabolically cheaper defenseless strains.",35906195

So far, we have not resolved the phylogenetic relationship within this group, making it difficult to trace its geographical origin, pattern of species diversification and history of host plant use. In this study, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships within the <i>C. gigantea</i> group using DNA sequences of eight (two mitochondrial and six nuclear) gene markers, and we inferred the ancestral areas and host plants of the group based on the resulting phylogeny. According to the results, the <i>C. gigantea</i> group may have diverged from its sister group (i.e., the <i>C. cristata</i> group) through vicariance between the northeastern Oriental region and Sundaland + Wallacea, and the subsequent diversification of the <i>C. gigantea</i> group occurred mostly in the northeastern Oriental region, although an Oriental-to-Sundaland dispersal was followed by vicariance between these two areas, which finally gave rise to the <i>C. gigantea-C. scindapsae</i> lineage in the latter area.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Combining GWAS and population genomic analyses to characterize coevolution in a legume-rhizobia symbiosis.,"The mutualism between legumes and rhizobia is clearly the product of past coevolution. However, the nature of ongoing evolution between these partners is less clear. To characterize the nature of recent coevolution between legumes and rhizobia, we used population genomic analysis to characterize selection on functionally annotated symbiosis genes as well as on symbiosis gene candidates identified through a two-species association analysis. For the association analysis, we inoculated each of 202 accessions of the legume host Medicago truncatula with a community of 88 Sinorhizobia (Ensifer) meliloti strains. Multistrain inoculation, which better reflects the ecological reality of rhizobial selection in nature than single-strain inoculation, allows strains to compete for nodulation opportunities and host resources and for hosts to preferentially form nodules and provide resources to some strains. We found extensive host by symbiont, that is, genotype-by-genotype, effects on rhizobial fitness and some annotated rhizobial genes bear signatures of recent positive selection. However, neither genes responsible for this variation nor annotated host symbiosis genes are enriched for signatures of either positive or balancing selection. This result suggests that stabilizing selection dominates selection acting on symbiotic traits and that variation in these traits is under mutation-selection balance. Consistent with the lack of positive selection acting on host genes, we found that among-host variation in growth was similar whether plants were grown with rhizobia or N-fertilizer, suggesting that the symbiosis may not be a major driver of variation in plant growth in multistrain contexts.",35793264

PAL113 and PAL227 isolate genomes encoded short-chain fatty acid biosynthetic pathways and plant fiber and chitin catabolism and other carbohydrate utilization genes common in related Lachnospiraceae species, yet the presence of operons containing flagellar assembly pathways were among several distinguishing features. In general, PAL113 and PAL227 isolates encode an array of gene products that would enable them to thrive in the insect gut environment and potentially play a role in host diet processing. We hypothesize that cladogenesis of these isolates could be due to their oxygen sensitivity, reliance upon the host for dispersal and genetic drift and not necessarily as a result of an ongoing mutualism.",35679131

In non-legumes especially monocots, it remains unknown whether certain <i>SNARE</i> genes are also involved in AM symbiosis. In this work, we studied a rice orthologous gene <i>OsSYP132</i>, which showed induced expression in mycorrhizal roots and two paralogous genes <i>OsSYP131a</i> and <i>OsSYP131b</i>, which were not induced by the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i>. After employing CRISPR/Cas9 technique to generate their mutants, the <i>Ossyp131a</i> homozygous mutant T<sub>0</sub> plants exhibited a dwarf phenotype and produced no fertile seeds, indicating a required role of this gene in seed fertility. Unlike the case in legume, the <i>Ossyp132</i> mutants exhibited normal mycorrhizal phenotype, so did the <i>Ossyp131b</i> mutants. In the <i>Ossyp131b Ossyp132</i> double mutants, however, the colonization rate and arbuscule abundance level decreased markedly, indicating an impaired fungal proliferation ability in rice roots. Such a defect was further confirmed by the reduced expression levels of AM marker genes. Our results in rice therefore demonstrated that while SYP13II members showed evolutionary and induction patterns specific to symbiosis, AM symbiosis is in fact controlled by the combined action of both SYP13I and SYP13II clades, revealing a functional redundancy among SYNTAXIN genes in mutualism.",35665185

Many bacteria can colonize the algal phycosphere, forming stable communities that gain preferential access to photosynthate and in return provide compounds such as B<sub>12</sub> . Extended coexistence can then drive gene loss, leading to greater algal-bacterial interdependence. In this study, we investigate how a recently evolved B<sub>12</sub> -dependent strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, metE7, forms a mutualism with certain bacteria, including the rhizobium Mesorhizobium loti and even a strain of the gut bacterium E. coli engineered to produce cobalamin. Although metE7 was supported by B<sub>12</sub> producers, its growth in co-culture was slower than the B<sub>12</sub> -independent wild-type, suggesting that high bacterial B<sub>12</sub> provision may be necessary to favour B<sub>12</sub> auxotrophs and their evolution. Moreover, we found that an E. coli strain that releases more B<sub>12</sub> makes a better mutualistic partner, and although this trait may be more costly in isolation, greater B<sub>12</sub> release provided an advantage in co-cultures. We hypothesize that, given the right conditions, bacteria that release more B<sub>12</sub> may be selected for, particularly if they form close interactions with B<sub>12</sub> -dependent algae.",35593514

Notable species are pathogens transmitted to mammals by blood-feeding arthropods. Mammalian pathogenicity evolved from basal, non-pathogenic host-associations; however, some non-pathogens are closely related to pathogens. One such species, <i>Rickettsia buchneri</i>, is prevalent in the blacklegged tick, <i>Ixodes scapularis</i>. While <i>I</i>. <i>scapularis</i> transmits several pathogens to humans, it does not transmit <i>Rickettsia</i> pathogens. We hypothesize that <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> established a mutualism with <i>I</i>. <i>scapularis</i>, blocking tick superinfection with <i>Rickettsia</i> pathogens. To improve estimates for assessing <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> infection frequency in blacklegged tick populations, we used comparative genomics to identify an <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> gene (<i>REIS_1424</i>) not present in other <i>Rickettsia</i> species present throughout the <i>I</i>. <i>scapularis</i> geographic range. Bioinformatic and phylogenomics approaches were employed to propose a function for the hypothetical protein (263 aa) encoded by <i>REIS_1424</i>. REIS_1424 has few analogs in other Rickettsiales genomes and greatest similarity to non-Proteobacteria proteins. This cohort of proteins varies greatly in size and domain composition, possessing characteristics of Recombination hotspot (Rhs) and contact dependent growth inhibition (CDI) toxins, with similarity limited to proximal C-termini (~145 aa). This domain was named CDI-like/Rhs-like C-terminal toxin (CRCT). As such proteins are often found as toxin-antidote (TA) modules, we interrogated REIS_1423 (151 aa) as a putative antidote. Indeed, REIS_1423 is similar to proteins encoded upstream of CRCT domain-containing proteins. Accordingly, we named these proteins CDI-like/Rhs-like C-terminal toxin antidotes (CRCA). <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> expressed both <i>REIS_1423</i> and <i>REIS_1424</i> in tick cell culture, and PCR assays showed specificity for <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> over other rickettsiae and utility for positive detection in three tick populations. Finally, phylogenomics analyses uncovered divergent CRCT/CRCA modules in varying states of conservation; however, only <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> and related Tamurae/Ixodes Group rickettsiae carry complete TA modules. We hypothesize that <i>Rickettsia</i> CRCT/CRCA modules circulate in the <i>Rickettsia</i> mobile gene pool, arming rickettsiae for battle over arthropod colonization. While its functional significance remains to be tested, <i>R</i>. <i>buchneri</i> CRCT/CRCA serves as a marker to positively identify infection and begin deciphering the role this endosymbiont plays in the biology of the blacklegged tick.",35592653
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Apex Predator Nematodes and Meso-Predator Bacteria Consume Their Basal Insect Prey through Discrete Stages of Chemical Transformations.,"Microbial symbiosis drives physiological processes of higher-order systems, including the acquisition and consumption of nutrients that support symbiotic partner reproduction. Metabolic analytics provide new avenues to examine how chemical ecology, or the conversion of existing biomass to new forms, changes over a symbiotic life cycle. We applied these approaches to the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, its mutualist bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophila, and the insects they infect. The nematode-bacterium pair infects, kills, and reproduces in an insect until nutrients are depleted. To understand the conversion of insect biomass over time into either nematode or bacterium biomass, we integrated information from trophic, metabolomic, and gene regulation analyses. Trophic analysis established bacteria as meso-predators and primary insect consumers. Nematodes hold a trophic position of 4.6, indicative of an apex predator, consuming bacteria and likely other nematodes. Metabolic changes associated with Galleria mellonella insect bioconversion were assessed using multivariate statistical analyses of metabolomics data sets derived from sampling over an infection time course. Statistically significant, discrete phases were detected, indicating the insect chemical environment changes reproducibly during bioconversion. A novel hierarchical clustering method was designed to probe molecular abundance fluctuation patterns over time, revealing distinct metabolite clusters that exhibit similar abundance shifts across the time course. Composite data suggest bacterial tryptophan and nematode kynurenine pathways are coordinated for reciprocal exchange of tryptophan and NAD<sup>+</sup> and for synthesis of intermediates that can have complex effects on bacterial phenotypes and nematode behaviors. Our analysis of pathways and metabolites reveals the chemistry underlying the recycling of organic material during carnivory. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The processes by which organic life is consumed and reborn in a complex ecosystem were investigated through a multiomics approach applied to the tripartite <i>Xenorhabdus</i> bacterium-<i>Steinernema</i> nematode-<i>Galleria</i> insect symbiosis. Trophic analyses demonstrate the primary consumers of the insect are the bacteria, and the nematode in turn consumes the bacteria. This suggests the <i>Steinernema-Xenorhabdus</i> mutualism is a form of agriculture in which the nematode cultivates the bacterial food sources by inoculating them into insect hosts. Metabolomics analysis revealed a shift in biological material throughout progression of the life cycle: active infection, insect death, and conversion of cadaver tissues into bacterial biomass and nematode tissue. We show that each phase of the life cycle is metabolically distinct, with significant differences including those in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid pathways. Our findings demonstrate that symbiotic life cycles can be defined by reproducible stage-specific chemical signatures, enhancing our broad understanding of metabolic processes that underpin a three-way symbiosis.",35543104

Despite the increasing recognition of linkages between bacterioplankton and dynamics of dinoflagellate blooms in the field, knowledge about the forms and functions of dinoflagellate-bacteria associations remains elusive, mainly due to the ephemeral and variable conditions in the field. In this study, we characterized the bacterial community associated with laboratory cultures of 144 harmful algal strains, including 130 dinoflagellates (covering all major taxonomic orders of dinoflagellates) and 14 non-dinoflagellates, via high-throughput sequencing for 16S rRNA gene amplicons. A total of 4577 features belonging to bacteria kingdom comprising of 24 phyla, 55 classes, 134 orders, 273 families, 716 genera, and 1104 species were recovered from the algal culture collection, and 3 phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) were universally present in all the culture samples. Bacterial communities in dinoflagellates cultures exhibited remarkable conservation across different algal strains, which were dominated by a relatively small number of taxa, most notably the <i></i>-proteobacteria <i>Methylophaga</i>, <i>Marinobacter</i> and <i>Alteromonas</i>. Although the bacterial community composition between dinoflagellates and non-dinoflagellate groups did not show significant difference in general, dinoflagellates harbored a large number of unique features (up to 3811) with relatively low individual abundance and enriched in the potential methylotrophs <i>Methylophaga.</i> While the bacterial assemblages associated with thecate and athecate dinoflagellates displayed no general difference in species composition and functional groups, athecate dinoflagellates appeared to accommodate more aerobic cellulolytic members of Actinobacteria, implying a more possible reliance on cellulose utilization as energy source. The extensive co-occurrence discovered here implied that the relationships between these algal species and the bacterial consortia could be viewed as either bilaterally beneficial (i.e., mutualism) or unilaterally beneficial at least to one party but virtually harmless to the other party (i.e., commensalism), whereas both scenarios support a long-term and stable co-existence rather than an exclusion of one or the other. Our results demonstrated that dinoflagellates-associated bacterial communities were similar in composition, with enrichment of potential uncultured methylotrophs to one-carbon compounds. This work enriches the knowledge about the fundamental functions of bacteria consortia associated with the phycospheres of dinoflagellates and other HABs-forming microalgae.",35457312

Moreover, these organs can have a significant role in altering the demographic forces that shape microbial genomes, driving population bottlenecks and horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Asymmetric sharing of pollinator fig wasps between two sympatric dioecious fig trees: a reflection of supply and demand or differences in the size of their figs?,"Host specificity among pollinator fig wasps (Agaonidae) depends on host plant specific volatile cues, but fig wasps must also pass through a narrow physical barrier (the ostiole) if they are to pollinate and oviposit. Across South East Asia the dioecious shrub Ficus hirta is associated with at least ten pollinator species allied to Valisia javana. Ficus triloba has a single recorded pollinator, Valisia esquirolianae. Receptive figs of F. hirta are usually much smaller than those of F. triloba, but at a mainland site where F. hirta has atypically large figs we identified both V. esquirolianae and V. javana from both Ficus species using COI and ITS2 sequencing. To investigate whether this host overlap was exceptional we reared fig wasps from the two trees elsewhere and recorded features that may facilitate host transfer between them, including attractant volatiles, reproductive phenology and the sizes of their figs and fig wasps. The two Ficus species were found to support both Valisia species at several of the sites, suggesting that the differences we detected in volatile profiles, ostiole sizes and pollinator head sizes are not strict barriers to host sharing. Valisia javana colonised F. triloba more frequently than V. esquirolianae colonised F. hirta. This asymmetric sharing of pollinators may reflect the relative abundance of the two species of fig wasps and differences in host reproductive phenology. Asynchronous flowering of individual F. hirta may favor local retention of pollinators, in contrast to the tree-wide synchrony of F. triloba figs, which can generate local shortages of V. esquirolianae. If the pollinator sharing by male figs of F. triloba and F. hirta also occurs in female figs then this could result in gene flow between them.",35316420

In order to identify molecular mechanisms involved in initial contact with native symbionts, we analyzed transcriptomic responses of Acropora tenuis larvae at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24h after their first contact with S. microadriaticum, as well as with non-native symbionts, including the non-symbiotic S. natans and the occasional symbiont, S. tridacnidorum. Some gene expression changes were detected in larvae inoculated with non-native symbionts at1h post-inoculation, but those returned to baseline levels afterward. In contrast, when larvae were exposed to native symbionts, we found that the number of differentially expressed genes gradually increased in relation to inoculation time. As a specific response to native symbionts, upregulation of pattern recognition receptor-like and transporter genes, and suppression of cellular function genes related to immunity and apoptosis, were exclusively observed. These findings indicate that coral larvae recognize differences between symbionts, and when the appropriate symbionts infect, they coordinate gene expression to establish stable mutualism.",35190599
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""","<i>Rhizobiales</i>-Specific RirA Represses a Naturally ""Synthetic"" Foreign Siderophore Gene Cluster To Maintain <i>Sinorhizobium</i>-Legume Mutualism.","Iron homeostasis is strictly regulated in cellular organisms. The <i>Rhizobiales</i> order enriched with symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria has evolved a lineage-specific regulator, RirA, responding to iron fluctuations. However, the regulatory role of RirA in bacterium-host interactions remains largely unknown. Here, we report that RirA is essential for mutualistic interactions of Sinorhizobium fredii with its legume hosts by repressing a gene cluster directing biosynthesis and transport of petrobactin siderophore. Genes encoding an inner membrane ABC transporter (<i>fat</i>) and the biosynthetic machinery (<i>asb</i>) of petrobactin siderophore are sporadically distributed in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. An outer membrane siderophore receptor gene (<i>fprA</i>) was naturally assembled with <i>asb</i> and <i>fat</i>, forming a long polycistron in S. fredii. An indigenous regulation cascade harboring an inner membrane protease (RseP), a sigma factor (FecI), and its anti-sigma protein (FecR) were involved in direct activation of the <i>fprA-asb-fat</i> polycistron. Operons harboring <i>fecI</i> and <i>fprA-asb-fat</i>, and those encoding the indigenous TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex delivering energy to the outer membrane transport activity, were directly repressed by RirA under iron-replete conditions. The <i>rirA</i> deletion led to upregulation of these operons and iron overload in nodules, impaired intracellular persistence, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation of rhizobia. Mutualistic defects of the <i>rirA</i> mutant can be rescued by blocking activities of this naturally ""synthetic"" circuit for siderophore biosynthesis and transport. These findings not only are significant for understanding iron homeostasis of mutualistic interactions but also provide insights into assembly and integration of foreign machineries for biosynthesis and transport of siderophores, horizontal transfer of which is selected in microbiota. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Iron is a public good explored by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The abundant ferric form is insoluble under neutral and basic pH conditions, and many bacteria secrete siderophores forming soluble ferric siderophore complexes, which can be then taken up by specific receptors and transporters. Siderophore biosynthesis and uptake machineries can be horizontally transferred among bacteria in nature. Despite increasing attention on the importance of siderophores in host-microbiota interactions, the regulatory integration process of transferred siderophore biosynthesis and transport genes is poorly understood in an evolutionary context. By focusing on the mutualistic rhizobium-legume symbiosis, here, we report how a naturally synthetic foreign siderophore gene cluster was integrated with the rhizobial indigenous regulation cascade, which is essential for maintaining mutualistic interactions.",35130720
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Nitrogen fertilization differentially affects the symbiotic capacity of two co-occurring ectomycorrhizal species.,"Forest trees rely on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to obtain growth-limiting nutrients. While addition of nitrogen (N) has the potential to disrupt these critical relationships, there is conflicting evidence as to the mechanism by which ECM:host mutualism may be affected. We evaluated how N fertilization altered host interactions and gene transcription between Eucalyptus grandis and Pisolithus microcarpus or Pisolithus albus, two closely related ECM species that typically co-occur within the same ecosystem. Our investigation demonstrated species-specific responses to elevated N: P. microcarpus maintained its ability to transport microbially sourced N to its host but had a reduced ability to penetrate into root tissues, while P. albus maintained its colonization ability but reduced delivery of N to its host. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that regulation of different suites of N-transporters may be responsible for these species-specific differences. In addition to N-dependent responses, we were also able to define a conserved 'core' transcriptomic response of Eucalyptus grandis to mycorrhization that was independent of abiotic conditions. Our results demonstrate that even between closely related ECM species, responses to N fertilization can vary considerably, suggesting that a better understanding of the breadth and mechanisms of their responses is needed to support forest ecosystems into the future.",35023254

The symbiosis is highly integrated involving systemic growth of the fungus throughout above-ground host parts and vertical transmission from plant to its offspring <i>via</i> host seeds. However, the nature of symbiosis is labile ranging from antagonistic to mutualistic depending on prevailing selection pressures. Both the loss of fungus in the maternal host lineage and horizontal transmission through sexual spores within the host population may partly explain the detected variation in symbiosis in wild grass populations. Epichlo species are commonly considered as pathogens when they produce sexual spores and partly castrate their host plant. This is the pathogenic end of the continuum from antagonistic to mutualistic interactions. Here we examined the population genetic structure of <i>E. festucae</i> to reveal the gene flow, importance of reproduction modes, and alkaloid potential of the symbiotic fungus in Europe. <i>Epichl</i>o-species are highly dependent on the host in survival and reproduction whilst benefits to the host are largely linked to defensive mutualism attributable to fungal-origin bioactive alkaloids that negatively affect vertebrate and/or invertebrate herbivores. We detected decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas compared to non-glaciated regions during the last glacial maximum period and found three major genetic clusters in <i>E. festucae</i> populations: southern, northeastern and northwestern Europe. Sexual reproduction may have a higher role than expected in Spanish <i>E. festucae</i> populations due to the predominance of unique genotypes and presence of both mating types in the region. In contrast, asexual reproduction <i>via</i> host seeds predominates in the Faroe Island and Finland in northern Europe due to the presence of biased mating-type ratios and large dominant genotypes in the <i>E. festucae</i> populations within the region. A substantially larger variation of alkaloid genotypes was observed in the fungal populations than expected, although the variability of the alkaloid genotypes within populations is considerably lower in northern than Spanish populations in southern Europe. <i>E. festucae</i> populations consist of different combinations of alkaloid classes from the gene clusters of ergot alkaloid and indole-terpenes, and from pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid gene. We suggest that the postglacial distribution history of the host grass, prevailing reproduction strategies of <i>E. festucae</i>, and local selection pressures likely explain a large part of the genetic variation observed in fungal populations among geographic regions. The identified alkaloid genotypes can be used by turfgrass breeders to improve resistance against herbivores in red fescue varieties and to develop new sustainable cultivars in Europe.",34925265

However, the lack of the host whole-genome information has impeded the full comprehension of the genotype/phenotype interface in Riftia. Here, we described the high-quality draft genome of Riftia, its complete mitogenome, and tissue-specific transcriptomic data. The Riftia genome presents signs of reductive evolution, with gene family contractions exceeding expansions. Expanded gene families are related to sulfur metabolism, detoxification, antioxidative stress, oxygen transport, immune system, and lysosomal digestion, reflecting evolutionary adaptations to the vent environment and endosymbiosis. Despite the derived body plan, the developmental gene repertoire in the gutless tubeworm is extremely conserved with the presence of a near intact and complete Hox cluster. Gene expression analyses establish that the trophosome is a multifunctional organ marked by intracellular digestion of endosymbionts, storage of excretory products, and hematopoietic functions. Overall, the plume and gonad tissues both in contact to the environment harbor highly expressed genes involved with cell cycle, programed cell death, and immunity indicating a high cell turnover and defense mechanisms against pathogens. We posit that the innate immune system plays a more prominent role into the establishment of the symbiosis during the infection in the larval stage, rather than maintaining the symbiostasis in the trophosome.

It is increasingly clear, however, that in addition to this evolutionary role, plasmids also manipulate the expression of a broad range of bacterial phenotypes. In this review, we argue that the effects that plasmids have on the expression of bacterial phenotypes may often represent plasmid adaptations, rather than mere deleterious side effects. We begin by summarizing findings from untargeted omics analyses, which give a picture of the global effects of plasmid acquisition on host cells. Thereafter, because many plasmids are capable of both vertical and horizontal transmission, we distinguish plasmid-mediated phenotypic effects into two main classes based upon their potential fitness benefit to plasmids: (i) those that promote the competitiveness of the host cell in a given niche and thereby increase plasmid vertical transmission, and (ii) those that promote plasmid conjugation and thereby increase plasmid horizontal transmission. Far from being mere vehicles for gene exchange, we propose that plasmids often act as sophisticated genetic parasites capable of manipulating their bacterial hosts for their own benefit.

Another type of obligate insect agriculture in Fiji involves the symbiosis between the ant <i>Philidris nagasau</i> and epiphytes in the genus <i>Squamellaria</i> (Rubiaceae) that the ants fertilize, defend, harvest, and depend on for nesting. All farmed <i>Squamellaria</i> form tubers (domatia) with preformed entrance holes and complex cavity networks occupied by <i>P</i>. <i>nagasau</i>. The inner surface of the domatia consists of smooth-surfaced walls where the ants nest and rear their brood, and warty-surfaced walls where they fertilize their crop by defecation. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify gene expression patterns associated with the smooth versus warty wall types. Since wall differentiation occurred in the most recent common ancestor of all farmed species of <i>Squamellaria</i>, our study also identifies genetic pathways co-opted following the emergence of agriculture. Warty-surfaced walls show many upregulated genes linked to auxin transport, root development, and nitrogen transport consistent with their root-like function; their defense-related genes are also upregulated, probably to protect these permeable areas from pathogen entry. In smooth-surfaced walls, genes functioning in suberin and wax biosynthesis are upregulated, contributing to the formation of an impermeable ant-nesting area in the domatium.

In plants, small RNA (sRNA)-mediated gene silencing (sRNA-MGS) plays pivotal roles in growth, development, and pathogen attack. Here, we explored the role of core components of Arabidopsis thaliana sRNA-MGS pathways during its interaction with Trichoderma. Upon interaction with Trichoderma, sRNA-MGS-related genes paralleled the expression of Arabidopsis defense-related genes, linked to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. SA- and JA-related genes were primed by Trichoderma in leaves after the application of the well-known pathogen-associated molecular patterns flg22 and chitin, respectively. Defense-related genes were primed in roots as well, but to different extents and behaviors. Phenotypical characterization of mutants in AGO genes and components of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway revealed that different sets of sRNA-MGS-related genes are essential for (i) the induction of systemic acquired resistance against Botrytis cinerea, (ii) the activation of the expression of plant defense-related genes, and (iii)root colonization by Trichoderma. Additionally, plant growth induced by Trichoderma depends on functional RdDM. Profiling of DNA methylation and histone N-tail modification patterns at the Arabidopsis Nitrile-Specifier Protein-4 (NSP4) locus, which is responsive to Trichoderma, showed altered epigenetic modifications in RdDM mutants. Furthermore, NSP4 is required for the induction of systemic acquired resistance against Botrytis and avoidance of enhanced root colonization by Trichoderma. Together, our results indicate that RdDM is essential in Arabidopsis to establish a beneficial relationship with Trichoderma. We propose that DNA methylation and histone modifications are required for plant priming by the beneficial fungus against B. cinerea.",34807478

Popular designations such as 'selfish DNA' and 'junk DNA,' common in the 1980s, may be either inaccurate or misleading, while a more enlightened view of the TE-host relationship covers a range from parasitism to mutualism. Both plant and animal hosts have evolved epigenetic mechanisms to reduce the impact of TEs, both by directly silencing them and by reducing their ability to transpose in the genome. However, TEs have also been co-opted by both plant and animal genomes to perform a variety of physiological functions, ranging from TE-derived proteins acting directly in normal biological functions to innovations in transcription factor activity and also influencing gene expression. Their presence, in fact, can affect a range of features at genome, phenotype, and population levels. The impact TEs have had on evolution is multifaceted, and many aspects still remain unexplored. In this review, the epigenetic control of TEs is contextualized according to the evolution of complex living systems.",34718084

Here, we present large-scale transcriptomic datasets of 25 fig wasp species with the aim of uncovering the genetic basis for host specificity. Our phylogenetic results support the monophyly of all genera associated with dioecious figs, and two genera associated with monoecious figs, <i>Eupristina</i> and <i>Platyscapa</i>, were revealed to be close relatives. We identified gene loss and gain, potentially rapidly evolving genes, and genes under positive selection.

Application of bio-fertilizer containing beneficial microbes contributes to disease suppression and is a promising strategy to control replanting disease. However, the effect of both replanting disease and bio-fertilizer amendment on the assembly of crop microbiota in leaves and roots and their relationships to crop yield and quality remains elusive. In these experiments, roots and leaves of Radix pseudostellariae were collected from different consecutive monoculture and bio-fertilizer amended fields, and the associated microbiota were characterized by bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Consecutive monoculture altered the bacterial community structure and composition and significantly increased the abundance of potential pathogenic Ralstonia and Fusarium oxysporum in leaves and roots. Furthermore, bio-fertilizer application alleviated replanting disease by decreasing the pathogen load, increasing the potential beneficial genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Paenibacillus, and Bradyrhizobium. The proportion of positive correlations in the co-occurrence network of bio-fertilizer application was the highest, implying that bio-fertilizer potentially enhanced ecological commensalism or mutualism of the bacterial community across the two compartments. Structural equation models indicated that bio-fertilizer had a positive and indirect effect on both yield and quality by shaping the leaf microbiota and the root microbiota. Our findings highlight the role of leaf and root microbiota on replanting disease, showing that bio-fertilizer contributes to alleviating replanting disease by improving microbe-microbe interactions.",34554283

Existing approaches for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often focused on the association analysis between host genes and the abundance of individual microbes, failing to characterize the genetic bases of microbial interactions that are thought to be important for microbiota structure, organization, and function. Here, we implement a behavioral model to quantify various patterns of microbe-microbe interactions, i.e., mutualism, antagonism, aggression, and altruism, and map host genes that modulate microbial networks constituted by these interaction types. We reanalyze a root-microbiome data involving 179 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and find that the four networks differ structurally in the pattern of bacterial-fungal interactions and microbiome complexity. We identify several fungus and bacterial hubs that play a central role in mediating microbial community assembly surrounding A. thaliana root systems. We detect 1142 significant host genetic variants throughout the plant genome and then implement Bayesian networks (BN) to reconstruct epistatic networks involving all significant SNPs, of which 91 are identified as hub QTLs. Results from gene annotation analysis suggest that most of the hub QTLs detected are in proximity to candidate genes, executing a variety of biological functions in plant growth and development, resilience against pathogens, root development, and abiotic stress resistance.

This nutrient-exchange mutualism is widely perceived as a bipartite interaction, but the presence and contributing effects of bacteria to this symbiosis are unknown. We used standard cultivation techniques and amplicon sequencing of the V4/V5 region of 16S rRNA gene to identify and compare diversity of bacterial taxa in embryonic capsules with that in the aquatic breeding habitat. Our sampling regime allowed us to investigate diversity among individual capsules of an egg mass and between two ponds and sampling years. Capsules contain much lower diversity of bacteria than pond water, and spatial and temporal variation in intracapsular and pond bacterial diversity was observed. Despite this variation, sequences corresponding to species in the orders Burkholderiales and Oligoflexales were either prevalent or abundant, or both. Isolates most commonly recovered from capsules were closely related to species in the genus Herbaspirillum (Burkholderiaceae); other isolates were pseudomonads, but in all cases are closely related to known vascular plant-associated species.

Most strains benefiting from shared goods were dysfunctional in biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins or mutants in central carbon metabolism. We tested cross-feeding potency in 1,444 strain pairs and mapped the interaction network between all functional groups of mutants. This network revealed that auxotrophs for vitamins are optimal cooperators. Lastly, we monitored how assemblies composed of dozens of auxotrophs change over time and observed that they rapidly and repeatedly coalesced to seven strain consortia composed primarily from vitamin auxotrophs. The composition of emerging consortia suggests that they were stabilized by multiple cross-feeding interactions.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Cell Growth Model with Stochastic Gene Expression Helps Understand the Growth Advantage of Metabolic Exchange and Auxotrophy.,"During cooperative growth, microbes often experience higher fitness by sharing resources via metabolite exchange. How competitive species evolve to cooperate is, however, not known. Moreover, existing models (based on optimization of steady-state resources or fluxes) are often unable to explain the growth advantage for the cooperating species, even for simple reciprocally cross-feeding auxotrophic pairs. We present here an abstract model of cell growth that considers the stochastic burst-like gene expression of biosynthetic pathways of limiting biomass precursor metabolites and directly connect the amount of metabolite produced to cell growth and division, using a ""metabolic sizer/adder"" rule. Our model recapitulates Monod's law and yields the experimentally observed right-skewed long-tailed distribution of cell doubling times. The model further predicts the growth effect of secretion and uptake of metabolites by linking it to changes in the internal metabolite levels. The model also explains why auxotrophs may grow faster when supplied with the metabolite they cannot produce and why two reciprocally cross-feeding auxotrophs can grow faster than prototrophs. Overall, our framework allows us to predict the growth effect of metabolic interactions in independent microbes and microbial communities, setting up the stage to study the evolution of these interactions. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Cooperative behaviors are highly prevalent in the wild, but their evolution is not understood. Metabolic flux models can demonstrate the viability of metabolic exchange as cooperative interactions, but steady-state growth models cannot explain why cooperators grow faster. We present a stochastic model that connects growth to the cell's internal metabolite levels and quantifies the growth effect of metabolite exchange and auxotrophy. We show that a reduction in gene expression noise can explain why cells that import metabolites or become auxotrophs can grow faster and why reciprocal cross-feeding of metabolites between complementary auxotrophs allows them to grow faster. Furthermore, our framework can simulate the growth of interacting cells, which will enable us to understand the possible trajectories of the evolution of cooperation <i>in silico</i>.",34342540
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Competitiveness for Nodule Colonization in Sinorhizobium meliloti: Combined <i>In Vitro</i>-Tagged Strain Competition and Genome-Wide Association Analysis.,"Associations between leguminous plants and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia are a classic example of mutualism between a eukaryotic host and a specific group of prokaryotic microbes. Although this symbiosis is in part species specific, different rhizobial strains may colonize the same nodule. Some rhizobial strains are commonly known as better competitors than others, but detailed analyses that aim to predict rhizobial competitive abilities based on genomes are still scarce. Here, we performed a bacterial genome-wide association (GWAS) analysis to define the genomic determinants related to the competitive capabilities in the model rhizobial species Sinorhizobium meliloti. For this, 13 tester strains were green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged and assayed versus 3 red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged reference competitor strains (Rm1021, AK83, and BL225C) in a Medicago sativa nodule occupancy test. Competition data and strain genomic sequences were employed to build a model for GWAS based on <i>k</i>-mers. Among the <i>k</i>-mers with the highest scores, 51 <i>k</i>-mers mapped on the genomes of four strains showing the highest competition phenotypes (>60% single strain nodule occupancy; GR4, KH35c, KH46, and SM11) versus BL225C. These <i>k</i>-mers were mainly located on the symbiosis-related megaplasmid pSymA, specifically on genes coding for transporters, proteins involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors, and proteins related to metabolism (e.g., fatty acids). The same analysis was performed considering the sum of single and mixed nodules obtained in the competition assays versus BL225C, retrieving <i>k</i>-mers mapped on the genes previously found and on <i>vir</i> genes. Therefore, the competition abilities seem to be linked to multiple genetic determinants and comprise several cellular components. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Decoding the competitive pattern that occurs in the rhizosphere is challenging in the study of bacterial social interaction strategies. To date, the single-gene approach has mainly been used to uncover the bases of nodulation, but there is still a knowledge gap regarding the main features that <i>a priori</i> characterize rhizobial strains able to outcompete indigenous rhizobia. Therefore, tracking down which traits make different rhizobial strains able to win the competition for plant infection over other indigenous rhizobia will improve the strain selection process and, consequently, plant yield in sustainable agricultural production systems. We proved that a <i>k</i>-mer-based GWAS approach can efficiently identify the competition determinants of a panel of strains previously analyzed for their plant tissue occupancy using double fluorescent labeling.

The aphid symbiont <i>Serratia symbiotica</i> is a valuable candidate for studying the evolution of bacterial symbiosis in insects because it includes a wide diversity of strains that reflect the diverse relationships in which bacteria can be engaged with insects, from pathogenic interactions to obligate intracellular mutualism. The recent discovery of culturable strains, which are hypothesized to resemble the ancestors of intracellular strains, provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying bacterial symbiosis in its early stages. In this study, we analyzed the genomes of three of these culturable strains that are pathogenic to aphid hosts, and performed comparative genomic analyses including mutualistic host-dependent strains. All three genomes are larger than those of the host-restricted <i>S. symbiotica</i> strains described so far, and show significant enrichment in pseudogenes and mobile elements, suggesting that these three pathogenic strains are in the early stages of the adaptation to their host. Compared to their intracellular mutualistic relatives, the three strains harbor a greater diversity of genes coding for virulence factors and metabolic pathways, suggesting that they are likely adapted to infect new hosts and are a potential source of metabolic innovation for insects. The presence in their genomes of secondary metabolism gene clusters associated with the production of antimicrobial compounds and phytotoxins supports the hypothesis that <i>S. symbiotia</i> symbionts evolved from plant-associated strains and that plants may serve as intermediate hosts. Mutualistic associations between insects and bacteria are the result of independent transitions to endosymbiosis initiated by the acquisition of environmental progenitors. In this context, the genomes of free-living <i>S. symbiotica</i> strains provide a rare opportunity to study the inventory of genes held by bacterial associates of insects that are at the gateway to a host-dependent lifestyle.",34268133

These conserved gut symbionts, which encompass five bacterial orders, have been studied previously for their primary nitrogen metabolism; however, little is known about their ability to biosynthesize specialized metabolites which can play a role in bacterial interactions between communities living in close proximity in the gut. To evaluate the biosynthetic potential of their gut symbionts, we mine 14 cultured isolate genomes and gut metagenomes across 17 <i>Cephalotes</i> species to explore the biodiversity of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) producing specialized metabolites. The diversity of BGCs across <i>Cephalotes</i> phylogeny was analyzed using sequence similarity networking and BGC phylogenetic reconstruction. Our results reveal that the conserved gut symbionts involved in the nutritional symbiosis possess 80% of all the 233 BGCs retrieved in this work. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of BGCs reveals different patterns of distribution, suggesting different mechanisms of conservation. A siderophore BGC shows high similarity in a single symbiont across different ant host species, whereas a BGC encoding the production of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) found different symbionts within a single host species. Additionally, BGCs were abundant in four of the five bacterial orders of conserved symbionts co-occurring in the hindgut. However, one major symbiont localized alone in the midgut lack BGCs. Because the spatial isolation prevents direct interaction with other symbionts, this result supports the idea that BGCs are maintained in bacteria living in close proximity but are dispensable for an alone-living symbiont. These findings together pave the way for studying the mechanisms of BGC conservation and evolution in gut bacterial genomes associated with <i>Cephalotes</i>. This work also provides a genetic background for further study, aiming to characterize bacterial specialized metabolites and to understand their functional role in multipartite mutualisms between conserved gut symbionts and <i>Cephalotes</i> turtle ants.",34267736

Here we use experimental evolution to causally show that initially plant-antagonistic Pseudomonas protegens bacteria evolve into mutualists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana within six plant growth cycles (6 months). This evolutionary transition is accompanied with increased mutualist fitness via two mechanisms: (i) improved competitiveness for root exudates and (ii) enhanced tolerance to the plant-secreted antimicrobial scopoletin whose production is regulated by transcription factor MYB72. Crucially, these mutualistic adaptations are coupled with reduced phytotoxicity, enhanced transcription of MYB72 in roots, and a positive effect on plant growth. Genetically, mutualism is associated with diverse mutations in the GacS/GacA two-component regulator system, which confers high fitness benefits only in the presence of plants.

However, there is still no extensive genomic evidence to reveal the evolutionary footprint of this long-term mutually beneficial symbiosis in fig pollinators. In fig syconia, there are also non-pollinator species. The non-pollinator species differ in their evolutionary and life histories from pollinators. We conducted comparative analyses on 11 newly sequenced fig wasp genomes and one previously published genome. The pollinators colonized the figs approximately 66.9 million years ago, consistent with the origin of host figs. Compared with non-pollinators, many more genes in pollinators were subject to relaxed selection. Seven genes were absent in pollinators in response to environmental stress and immune activation. Pollinators had more streamlined gene repertoires in the innate immune system, chemosensory toolbox, and detoxification system.

We know that symbiotic relationships occur along the whole phylogeny of the group, however, little is known about their evolution. Theoretical studies show that there are two routes for the development of parasitism, yet few authors have investigated the evolution of these characteristics using molecular tools. In the present study, we inferred a wide dated molecular phylogeny, based on the 18S rDNA gene, for the entire Ciliophora phylum, mapped life habits throughout the evolutionary time, and evaluated whether symbiotic relationships were linked to the variation in diversification rates and to the mode of evolution of ciliates. Our results showed that the last common ancestor for Ciliophora was likely a free-living organism, and that parasitism is a recent adaptation in ciliates, emerging more than once and independently via two distinct routes: (i) a free-living ciliate evolved into a mutualistic organism and, later, into a parasitic organism, and (ii) a free-living ciliate evolved directly into a parasitic organism. Furthermore, we have found a significant increase in the diversification rate of parasitic and mutualistic ciliates compared with their free-living conspecifics.

Here, we characterized the genomic architecture and functional gene content of this culturable symbiont using genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics in combination with in vitro assays. Despite retaining a large linear chromosome (7.3 Mb), the wasp symbiont accumulated frameshift mutations in more than a third of its protein-coding genes, indicative of incipient genome erosion. Although many of the frameshifted genes were still expressed, the encoded proteins were not detected, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. Most pseudogenization events affected accessory genes, regulators, and transporters, but ""<i>Streptomyces philanthi</i>"" also experienced mutations in central metabolic pathways, resulting in auxotrophies for biotin, proline, and arginine that were confirmed experimentally in axenic culture.

The invasive cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cingulata arrived in Europe from North America ~40years ago, where it now co-occurs with the native cherry pest R.cerasi. This shared distribution has been proposed to have led to the horizontal transfer of different Wolbachia strains between the two species. To better understand transmission dynamics, we performed a comparative genome study of the strain wCin2 in its native United States and invasive European populations of R.cingulata with wCer2 in European R.cerasi. Previous multilocus sequence genotyping (MLST) of six genes implied that the source of wCer2 in R.cerasi was wCin2 from R.cingulata. However, we report genomic evidence discounting the recent horizontal transfer hypothesis for the origin of wCer2. Despite near identical sequences for the MLST markers, substantial sequence differences for other loci were found between wCer2 and wCin2, as well as structural rearrangements, and differences in prophage, repetitive element, gene content, and cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing genes.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",The boom and bust of the aphid's essential amino acid metabolism across nymphal development.,"Within long-term symbioses, animals integrate their physiology and development with their symbiont. In a model nutritional mutualism, aphids harbor the endosymbiont, Buchnera, within specialized bacteriocyte cells. Buchnera synthesizes essential amino acids (EAAs) and vitamins for their host, which are lacking from the aphid's plant sap diet. It is unclear if the aphid host differentially expresses aphid EAA metabolism pathways and genes that collaborate with Buchnera for the production of EAA and vitamins throughout nymphal development when feeding on plants. It is also unclear if aphid bacteriocytes are differentially methylated throughout aphid development as DNA methylation may play a role in gene regulation. By analyzing aphid gene expression, we determined that the bacteriocyte is metabolically more active in metabolizing Buchnera's EAAs and vitamins early in nymphal development compared to intermediate or later immature and adult lifestages. The largest changes in aphid bacteriocyte gene expression, especially for aphid genes that collaborate with Buchnera, occurred during the 3rd to 4th instar transition. During this transition, there is a huge shift in the bacteriocyte from a high energy ""nutrient-consuming state"" to a ""recovery and growth state"" where patterning and signaling genes and pathways are upregulated and differentially methylated, and de novo methylation is reduced as evidenced by homogenous DNA methylation profiles after the 2nd instar. Moreover, bacteriocyte number increased and Buchnera's titer decreased throughout aphid nymphal development.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Engineering Cooperation in an Anaerobic Coculture.,"Over the past century, microbiologists have studied organisms in pure culture, yet it is becoming increasingly apparent that the majority of biological processes rely on multispecies cooperation and interaction. While little is known about how such interactions permit cooperation, even less is known about how cooperation arises. To study the emergence of cooperation in the laboratory, we constructed both a commensal community and an obligate mutualism using the previously noninteracting bacteria <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> and <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> Incorporation of a glycerol utilization plasmid (pGUT2) enabled <i>S. oneidensis</i> to metabolize glycerol and produce acetate as a carbon source for <i>G. sulfurreducens</i>, establishing a cross-feeding, commensal coculture. In the commensal coculture, both species coupled oxidative metabolism to the respiration of fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. Deletion of the gene encoding fumarate reductase in the <i>S. oneidensis</i>/pGUT2 strain shifted the coculture with <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> to an obligate mutualism where neither species could grow in the absence of the other. A shift in metabolic strategy from glycerol catabolism to malate metabolism was associated with obligate coculture growth. Further targeted deletions in malate uptake and acetate generation pathways in <i>S. oneidensis</i> significantly inhibited coculture growth with <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> The engineered coculture between <i>S. oneidensis</i> and <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> provides a model laboratory system to study the emergence of cooperation in bacterial communities, and the shift in metabolic strategy observed in the obligate coculture highlights the importance of genetic change in shaping microbial interactions in the environment.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbes seldom live alone in the environment, yet this scenario is approximated in the vast majority of pure-culture laboratory experiments. Here, we develop an anaerobic coculture system to begin understanding microbial physiology in a more complex setting but also to determine how anaerobic microbial communities can form. Using synthetic biology, we generated a coculture system where the facultative anaerobe <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> consumes glycerol and provides acetate to the strict anaerobe <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> In the commensal system, growth of <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> is dependent on the presence of <i>S. oneidensis</i> To generate an obligate coculture, where each organism requires the other, we eliminated the ability of <i>S. oneidensis</i> to respire fumarate. An unexpected shift in metabolic strategy from glycerol catabolism to malate metabolism was observed in the obligate coculture. Our work highlights how metabolic landscapes can be expanded in multispecies communities and provides a system to evaluate the evolution of cooperation under anaerobic conditions.",33771781

ICOSL has been implicated in the enhancement of pattern recognition receptor signaling in dendritic cells, induction of IL-10 production by CD4 T cells, and the generation of high-affinity antibodies to specific antigens-all of which can potentially explain its involvement in gastrointestinal inflammation. Here, we show that murine ICOSL deficiency results in significant enrichment of IL-10-producing CD4 T cells particularly in the proximal large intestine. Transient depletion of IL-10-producing cells from adult ICOSL-deficient mice induced severe colonic inflammation that was prevented when mice were first treated with metronidazole. ICOSL-deficient mice displayed reduced IgA and IgG antibodies in the colon mucus and impaired serum antibody recognition of microbial antigens, including flagellins derived from mucus-associated bacteria of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family. Confirming the synergy between ICOSL and IL-10, ICOSL deficiency coupled with CD4-specific deletion of the <i>Il10</i> gene resulted in juvenile onset colitis that was impeded when pups were fostered by ICOSL-sufficient dams. In this setting, we found that both maternally acquired and host-derived antibodies contribute to the life anti-commensal antibody repertoire that mediates this protection in early life. Collectively, our findings reveal a partnership between ICOSL-dependent anti-commensal antibodies and IL-10 in adaptive immune regulation of the microbiota in the large intestine. Furthermore, we identify ICOSL deficiency as an effective platform for exploring the functions of anti-commensal antibodies in host-microbiota mutualism.",33753483
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Low host specificity and broad geographical ranges in a community of parasitic non-pollinating fig wasps (Sycoryctinae; Chalcidoidea).,"Plants, phytophagous insects and their parasitoids form the most diverse assemblages of macroscopic organisms on earth. Enclosed assemblages in particular represent a tractable system for studying community assembly and diversification. Communities associated with widespread plant species are especially suitable as they facilitate a comparative approach. Pantropical fig-wasp communities represent a remarkably well-replicated system, ideal for studying these historical processes. We expect high dispersal ability in non-pollinating fig wasps to result in lower geographical turnover in comparison to pollinating fig wasps. The ability of non-pollinating wasps to utilise a number of hosts (low host specificity) is a key determinant of overall geographical range, with intraspecific competition becoming a constraining factor should diet breadth overlap among species. Finally, we expect conserved community structure throughout the host range. We aim to test these expectations, derived from population genetic and community studies, using the multi-trophic insect community associated with Ficus hirta throughout its 3,500km range across continental and insular Asia. We collect molecular evidence from one coding mitochondrial gene, one non-coding nuclear gene and multiple microsatellites across 25 geographical sites. Using these data, we establish species boundaries, determine levels of host specificity among non-pollinating fig wasps and quantify geographical variation in community composition. We find low host specificity in two genera of non-pollinating fig wasps. Functional community structure is largely conserved across the range of the host fig, despite limited correspondence between the ranges of non-pollinator and pollinator species. While nine pollinators are associated with Ficus hirta, the two non-pollinator tribes developing in its figs each contained only four species. Contrary to predictions, we find stronger isolation by distance in non-pollinators than pollinators. Long-lived non-pollinators may disperse more gradually and be less reliant on infrequent long-distance dispersal by wind currents. Segregation among non-pollinating species across their range is suggestive of competitive exclusion and we propose that this may be a result of increased levels of local adaptation and moderate, but regular, rates of dispersal. Our findings provide one more example of lack of strict codiversification in the geographical diversification of plant-associated insect communities.",33738802
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""","Candidate genes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon differentiation between cryptic, parabiotic ant species.","Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are highly diverse and have multiple functions, including communication and waterproofing. CHC profiles form species-specific, complex blends of up to 150 compounds. Especially in ants, even closely related species can have largely different profiles, raising the question how CHC differences are mirrored in the regulation of biosynthetic pathways. The neotropical ants Crematogaster levior and Camponotus femoratus both consist of two cryptic species each that are morphologically similar, but express strongly different CHC profiles. This is ideal to study the molecular basis of CHC differences. We thus investigated gene expression differences in fat-body transcriptomes of these ants. Despite common garden conditions, we found several thousand differentially expressed transcripts within each cryptic species pair. Many of these were related to metabolic processes, probably accounting for physiological differences. Moreover, we identified candidate genes from five gene families involved in CHC biosynthesis. By assigning candidate transcripts to orthologs in Drosophila, we inferred which CHCs might be influenced by differential gene expression. Expression of these candidate genes was often mirrored in the CHC profiles. For example, Cr. levior A, which has longer CHCs than its cryptic sister species, had a higher expression of elongases and a lower expression of fatty acyl- CoA reductases. This study is one of the first to identify CHC candidate genes in ants and will provide a basis for further research on the genetic basis of CHC biosynthesis.",33729492
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Hologenome analysis reveals dual symbiosis in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent snail Gigantopelta aegis.,"Animals endemic to deep-sea hydrothermal vents often form obligatory symbioses with bacteria, maintained by intricate host-symbiont interactions. Most genomic studies on holobionts have not investigated both sides to similar depths. Here, we report dual symbiosis in the peltospirid snail Gigantopelta aegis with two gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts: a sulfur oxidiser and a methane oxidiser. We assemble high-quality genomes for all three parties, including a chromosome-level host genome. Hologenomic analyses reveal mutualism with nutritional complementarity and metabolic co-dependency, highly versatile in transporting and using chemical energy. Gigantopelta aegis likely remodels its immune system to facilitate dual symbiosis. Comparisons with Chrysomallon squamiferum, a confamilial snail with a single sulfur-oxidising gammaproteobacterial endosymbiont, show that their sulfur-oxidising endosymbionts are phylogenetically distant. This is consistent with previous findings that they evolved endosymbiosis convergently. Notably, the two sulfur-oxidisers share the same capabilities in biosynthesising nutrients lacking in the host genomes, potentially a key criterion in symbiont selection.",33608555

Protection against pathogens and support of beneficial, symbiotic, microorganisms are sustained by a blend of conserved and clade-specific plant mechanisms evolving at different speeds.

The presence of microorganisms in this symbiotic system has been reported, and the symbiotic role of some fungi involved in the myrmecophytic interactions has been described. In this work we focus on bacteria within this mutualism, conducting isolations and screening for antimicrobial activities, genome sequencing, and biochemical characterization. We show that <i>Pantoea</i>, <i>Rhizobium</i>, <i>Methylobacterium</i>, <i>Streptomyces</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> are the most common cultivable genera of bacteria. Interestingly, <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. isolates showed potent activity against 83% of the pathogens tested in our antimicrobial activity assays, including a phytopathogenic fungus isolated from <i>Cecropia</i> samples. Given the predicted nitrogen limitations associated with the fungal patches within this myrmecophyte, we performed nitrogen fixation analyses on the bacterial isolates within the Proteobacteria and show the potential for nitrogen fixation in <i>Pseudomonas</i> strains. The genome of one <i>Pseudomonas</i> strain was sequenced and analyzed. The gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLPs) was identified, and we found mutations that may be related to the loss of function in the dual epimerization/condensation domains. The compound was isolated, and its structure was determined, corresponding to the antifungal viscosinamide. Our findings of diazotrophy and production of viscosinamide in multiple <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates suggests that this bacterial genus may play an important role in the <i>Cecropia-Azteca</i> symbiosis.",33597940
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Three-dimensional biofilm colony growth supports a mutualism involving matrix and nutrient sharing.,"Life in a three-dimensional biofilm is typical for many bacteria, yet little is known about how strains interact in this context. Here, we created essential gene CRISPR interference knockdown libraries in biofilm-forming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with wild type. Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.",33594973

Nutritional supplementation has been proposed in the verrucomicrobial endosymbiont <i>Xiphinematobacter</i> sp., which lives within a globally widespread group of plant-parasitic nematodes that vector damaging nepoviruses to plants. Only one genome sequence has been published from this symbiont, leaving unanswered questions about its diversity, host range, role, and selective pressures within its hosts. Because its hosts are exceptionally resistant to culturing, this symbiont is best studied through advanced genomic approaches. To analyze the role of <i>Xiphinematobacter</i> sp. in its host, sequencing was performed on nematode communities, and then genomes were extracted for comparative genomics, gene ontology enrichment tests, polymorphism analysis, de Bruijn-based genome-wide association studies, and tests of pathway- and site-specific selection on genes predicted play a role in the symbiosis. Results showed a closely clustered set of <i>Xiphinematobacter</i> isolates with reduced genomes of 917 kbp, for which a new species was proposed. Symbionts shared only 2.3% of genes with outgroup <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>, but comparative analyses showed high conservation of all 10 essential amino acid (EAA) biosynthesis pathways plus several vitamin pathways. These findings were supported by gene ontology enrichment tests and high polymorphisms in these pathways compared with background. Genome-wide association analysis confirmed high between-species fixation of alleles with significant functional enrichment for EAA and thiamine synthesis. Strong positive selection was detected on sites within these pathways, despite several being under increased purifying selection. Together, these results suggest that supplementation of EAAs missing in the host diet may drive this widespread symbiosis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> <i>Xiphinematobacter</i> spp. are distinctly evolved intracellular symbionts in the phylum <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>, which includes the important human gut-associated microbe <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and many highly abundant free-living soil microbes.

This study examined the hypothesis that the key to this symbiont's stable evolutionary association with its host is through provisioning nutrients that its host cannot make that may be lacking in the nematode's plant phloem diet, such as essential amino acids and several vitamins. The significance of our research is in demonstrating, using population genomics, the signatures of selective pressure on these hypothesized roles to ultimately learn how this independently evolved symbiont functionally mirrors symbionts of phloem-feeding insects.",33531407

We evolved turnip mosaic potyvirus in well-watered and drought conditions in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions that differ in their response to virus infection. Virus adaptation occurred in all accessions independently of watering status. Drought-evolved viruses conferred a significantly higher drought tolerance to infected plants. By contrast, nonsignificant increases in tolerance were observed in plants infected with viruses evolved under standard watering. The magnitude of this effect was dependent on the plant accessions. Differences in tolerance were correlated to alterations in the expression of host genes, some involved in regulation of the circadian clock, as well as in deep changes in the balance of phytohormones regulating defense and growth signaling pathways. Our results show that viruses can promote host survival in situations of abiotic stress, with the magnitude of such benefit being a selectable trait.",33526695
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Red-light is an environmental effector for mutualism between begomovirus and its vector whitefly.,"Environments such as light condition influence the spread of infectious diseases by affecting insect vector behavior. However, whether and how light affects the host defense which further affects insect preference and performance, remains unclear, nor has been demonstrated how pathogens co-adapt light condition to facilitate vector transmission. We previously showed that begomoviral C1 inhibits MYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling to establish plant-dependent mutualism with its insect vector. Here we show red-light as an environmental catalyzer to promote mutualism of whitefly-begomovirus by stabilizing C1, which interacts with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factors. PIFs positively control plant defenses against whitefly by directly binding to the promoter of terpene synthase genes and promoting their transcription. Moreover, PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and jasmonate signaling and regulate the transcription of terpene synthase genes. However, begomovirus encoded C1 inhibits PIFs' and MYC2' transcriptional activity via disturbing their dimerization, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses.

Almost all filarial nematode species infecting humans live in mutualism with Wolbachia endosymbionts, present in somatic hypodermal tissues but also in the female germline which ensures their vertical transmission to the nematode progeny. These -proteobacteria potentially provision their host with essential metabolites and protect the parasite against the vertebrate immune response. In the absence of Wolbachia wBm, B. malayi females become sterile, and the filarial nematode lifespan is greatly reduced. In order to better comprehend this symbiosis, we investigated the adaptation of wBm to the host nematode soma and germline, and we characterized these cellular environments to highlight their specificities. Dual RNAseq experiments were performed at the tissue-specific and ovarian developmental stage levels, reaching the resolution of the germline mitotic proliferation and meiotic differentiation stages. We found that most wBm genes, including putative effectors, are not differentially regulated between infected tissues. However, two wBm genes involved in stress responses are upregulated in the hypodermal chords compared to the germline, indicating that this somatic tissue represents a harsh environment to which wBm have adapted. A comparison of the B. malayi and C. elegans germline transcriptomes reveals a poor conservation of genes involved in the production of oocytes, with the filarial germline proliferative zone relying on a majority of genes absent from C. elegans. The first orthology map of the B. malayi genome presented here, together with tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses, indicate that the early steps of oogenesis are a developmental process involving genes specific to filarial nematodes, that likely result from evolutionary innovations supporting the filarial parasitic lifestyle.",33406151

We find that symbiosis genes experience high rates of HT among rhizobial lineages but also bear signatures of purifying selection (low Ka : Ks). HT and purifying selection appear to be particularly strong in genes involved in initiating the symbiosis (e.g. nodulation) and in genome-wide association candidates for mediating benefits provided to the host.

We planted 50 legume genotypes in a greenhouse under ambient lightand shade to reflect reduced carbon availability for plants. We found an expected reduction under shaded conditions for plant performance traits, such as leaf number, abovegroundand belowground biomass, and a mutualism-related trait, nodule number. We also found GE for nodule number, with 83% of this interaction due to shifts in genotype fitness rank order across light environments, coupled with strong positive directional selection on nodule number regardless of light environment.

We report the assembly of closed genomes for two novel wolbachiae, <i>w</i>CfeT and <i>w</i>CfeJ, found co-infecting cat fleas (<i>Ctenocephalides felis</i>) of the Elward Laboratory colony (Soquel, CA, USA). <i>w</i>CfeT is basal to nearly all described <i>Wolbachia</i> supergroups, while <i>w</i>CfeJ is related to supergroups C, D and F. Both genomes contain laterally transferred genes that inform on the evolution of <i>Wolbachia</i> host associations. <i>w</i>CfeT carries the Biotin synthesis Operon of Obligate intracellular Microbes (BOOM); our analyses reveal five independent acquisitions of BOOM across the <i>Wolbachia</i> tree, indicating parallel evolution towards mutualism. Alternately, <i>w</i>CfeJ harbors a toxin-antidote operon analogous to the <i>w</i>Pip <i>cinAB</i> operon recently characterized as an inducer of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in flies. <i>w</i>CfeJ <i>cinB</i> and three adjacent genes are collectively similar to large modular toxins encoded in CI-like operons of certain <i>Wolbachia</i> strains and <i>Rickettsia</i> species, signifying that CI toxins streamline by fission of large modular toxins.

The genus Ensifer (syn. Sinorhizobium) contains diverse plant-associated bacteria, a subset of which can fix nitrogen in symbiosis with legumes. To gain insights into the evolution of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF), and interkingdom mutualisms more generally, we performed extensive phenotypic, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of the genus Ensifer. The data suggest that SNF likely emerged several times within the genus Ensifer through independent horizontal gene transfer events. Yet, the majority (105 of 106) of the Ensifer strains with the nodABC and nifHDK nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes were found within a single, monophyletic clade. Comparative genomics highlighted several differences between the ""symbiotic"" and ""nonsymbiotic"" clades, including divergences in their pangenome content. Additionally, strains of the symbiotic clade carried 325 fewer genes, on average, and appeared to have fewer rRNA operons than strains of the nonsymbiotic clade. Initial characterization of a subset of ten Ensifer strains identified several putative phenotypic differences between the clades. Tested strains of the nonsymbiotic clade could catabolize 25% more carbon sources, on average, than strains of the symbiotic clade, and they were better able to grow in LB medium and tolerate alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the tested strains of the symbiotic clade were better able to tolerate heat stress and acidic conditions.

In addition, the opportunity to undertake comparative genomic analyses is growing rapidly. This is especially true for fungi due to their small genome sizes (i.e., mean 1C=44.2Mb). Given these opportunities and aiming to gain novel insights into the evolution of mutualisms, we focus on comparing the quality of whole genome assemblies for fungus-growing ants cultivars (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Attini) and a free-living relative. Our analyses reveal that currently available methodologies and pipelines for analyzing whole-genome sequence data need refining. By using different genome assemblers, we show that the genome assembly size depends on what software is used. This, in turn, impacts gene number predictions, with higher gene numbers correlating positively with genome assembly size. Furthermore, the majority of fungal genome size data currently available are based on estimates derived from whole-genome assemblies generated from short-read genome data, rather than from the more accurate technique of flow cytometry. Here, we estimated the haploid genome sizes of three ant fungal symbionts by flow cytometry using the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. (1871) as a calibration standard. We found that published genome sizes based on genome assemblies are 2.5- to 3-fold larger than our estimates based on flow cytometry.

We apply three approaches-bioinformatics, analytical modelling and computational simulation-to understand the diverse gene content of prophages. In the bioinformatics work, we examine the distributions of over 50,000 annotated prophage genes identified in 1384 prophage sequences, comparing the gene repertoires of intact and incomplete prophages. These data indicate that genes involved in the replication, packaging, and release of phage particles have been preferentially lost in incomplete prophages, while tail fiber, transposase and integrase genes are significantly enriched. Consistent with these results, our mathematical and computational approaches predict that genes involved in phage lytic function are preferentially lost, resulting in shorter prophages that often retain genes that benefit the host. Informed by these models, we offer novel hypotheses for the enrichment of integrase and transposase genes in cryptic prophages. Overall, we demonstrate that functional and cryptic prophages represent a diversity of genetic sequences that evolve along a parasitism-mutualism continuum.",33275597
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Beyond the pan-genome: current perspectives on the functional and practical outcomes of the distributed genome hypothesis.,"The principle of monoclonality with regard to bacterial infections was considered immutable prior to 30 years ago. This view, espoused by Koch for acute infections, has proven inadequate regarding chronic infections as persistence requires multiple forms of heterogeneity among the bacterial population. This understanding of bacterial plurality emerged from a synthesis of what-were-then novel technologies in molecular biology and imaging science. These technologies demonstrated that bacteria have complex life cycles, polymicrobial ecologies, and evolve in situ via the horizontal exchange of genic characters. Thus, there is an ongoing generation of diversity during infection that results in far more highly complex microbial communities than previously envisioned. This perspective is based on the fundamental tenet that the bacteria within an infecting population display genotypic diversity, including gene possession differences, which result from horizontal gene transfer mechanisms including transformation, conjugation, and transduction. This understanding is embodied in the concepts of the supragenome/pan-genome and the distributed genome hypothesis (DGH). These paradigms have fostered multiple researches in diverse areas of bacterial ecology including host-bacterial interactions covering the gamut of symbiotic relationships including mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. With regard to the human host, within each of these symbiotic relationships all bacterial species possess attributes that contribute to colonization and persistence; those species/strains that are pathogenic also encode traits for invasion and metastases.

Here we decipher the poplar-root JA-perception complex centered on PtJAZ6, a co-repressor of JA-signaling targeted by the effector protein MiSSP7 from the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor during symbiotic development. Through protein-protein interaction studies in yeast we determined the poplar root proteins interacting with PtJAZ6. Moreover, we assessed via yeast triple-hybrid how the mutualistic effector MiSSP7 reshapes the association between PtJAZ6 and its partner proteins. In the absence of the symbiotic effector, PtJAZ6 interacts with the transcription factors PtMYC2s and PtJAM1.1. In addition, PtJAZ6 interacts with it-self and with other Populus JAZ proteins. Finally, MiSSP7 strengthens the binding of PtJAZ6 to PtMYC2.1 and antagonizes PtJAZ6 homo-/heterodimerization.

In this study, we show that inactivating the <i>ribBA</i> gene does not cause riboflavin auxotrophy under free-living conditions and that, as shown for RibBAs from other bacteria, the GTP cyclohydrolase II domain has no enzymatic activity. For this reason, we have renamed the annotated <i>ribBA</i> as <i>ribBX</i>. Because we were unable to identify other <i>ribBA</i> or <i>ribA</i> and <i>ribB</i> homologs in the genome of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285, we hypothesize that the ORS285 strain can use unconventional enzymes or an alternative pathway for the initial steps of riboflavin biosynthesis. Inactivating <i>ribBX</i> has a drastic impact on the interaction of <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285 with many of the tested <i>Aeschynomene</i> spp. In these <i>Aeschynomene</i> spp., the ORS285 <i>ribBX</i> mutant is able to infect the plant host cells but the intracellular infection is not maintained and the nodules senesce early. This phenotype can be complemented by reintroduction of the 3,4-DHBP synthase domain alone. Our results indicate that, in <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> ORS285, the RibBX protein is not essential for riboflavin biosynthesis under free-living conditions and we hypothesize that its activity is needed to sustain riboflavin biosynthesis under certain symbiotic conditions.[Formula: see text] Copyright  2021 The Author(s).

Amoeba-bacterium interactions contribute to the study of predation, symbiosis, pathogenesis, and human health. Given the complexity of their relationships, it is necessary to understand the ecology and evolution of their interactions. In this paper, we provide an updated review of the current understanding of amoeba-bacterium interactions. We start by discussing the diversity of amoebae and their bacterial partners. We also define three types of ecological interactions between amoebae and bacteria and discuss their different outcomes. Finally, we focus on the implications of amoeba-bacterium interactions on human health, horizontal gene transfer, drinking water safety, and the evolution of symbiosis.

Recent work suggests that insects also frequently associate with actinobacterial symbionts that produce molecules to help defend against parasites and predators. Here we explore a potential association between Actinobacteria and two species of fungus-farming ambrosia beetles, <i>Xyleborinus saxesenii</i> and <i>Xyleborus affinis</i>. We isolated and identified actinobacterial and fungal symbionts from laboratory reared nests, and characterized small molecules produced by the putative actinobacterial symbionts. One 16S rRNA phylotype of <i>Streptomyces</i> (XylebKG-1) was abundantly and consistently isolated from the galleries and adults of <i>X. saxesenii</i> and <i>X. affinis</i> nests. In addition to <i>Raffaelea sulphurea</i>, the symbiont that <i>X. saxesenii</i> cultivates, we also repeatedly isolated a strain of <i>Nectria</i> sp. that is an antagonist of this mutualism. Inhibition bioassays between <i>Streptomyces griseus</i> XylebKG-1 and the fungal symbionts from <i>X. saxesenii</i> revealed strong inhibitory activity of the actinobacterium toward the fungal antagonist <i>Nectria</i> sp. but not the fungal mutualist <i>R. sulphurea.</i> Bioassay guided HPLC fractionation of <i>S. griseus</i> XylebKG-1 culture extracts, followed by NMR and mass spectrometry, identified cycloheximide as the compound responsible for the observed growth inhibition. A biosynthetic gene cluster putatively encoding cycloheximide was also identified in <i>S. griseus</i> XylebKG-1. The consistent isolation of a single 16S phylotype of <i>Streptomyces</i> from two species of ambrosia beetles, and our finding that a representative isolate of this phylotype produces cycloheximide, which inhibits a parasite of the system but not the cultivated fungus, suggests that these actinobacteria may play defensive roles within these systems.",33101237

In contrast to antagonistic interactions, however, we, by and large, do not understand how this variation arises, how it is maintained, nor its implications for future evolutionary change. Currently, we rely on phenotypic models to address the persistence of mutualistic symbioses, but the success of an interaction almost certainly depends heavily on genetic interactions. In this review, we argue that evolutionary genetic models could provide a framework for understanding the causes and consequences of diversity and why selection may favour processes that maintain variation in mutualistic interactions.",33047414

The Ficus genus includes species that have evolved a species-specific mutualism system with wasp pollinators. We sequenced genomes of the Chinese banyan tree, F.microcarpa, and a species lacking aerial roots, F.hispida, and one wasp genome coevolving with F.microcarpa, Eupristina verticillata. Comparative analysis of the two Ficus genomes revealed dynamic karyotype variation associated with adaptive evolution. Copy number expansion of auxin-related genes from duplications and elevated auxin production are associated with aerial root development in F.microcarpa. A male-specific AGAMOUS paralog, FhAG2, was identified as a candidate gene for sex determination in F.hispida. Population genomic analyses of Ficus species revealed genomic signatures of morphological and physiological coadaptation with their pollinators involving terpenoid- and benzenoid-derived compounds.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Massive rhizobial genomic variation associated with partner quality in Lotus-Mesorhizobium symbiosis.,"Variation in partner quality is commonly observed in diverse cooperative relationships, despite the theoretical prediction that selection favoring high-quality partners should eliminate such variation. Here, we investigated how genetic variation in partner quality could be maintained in the nitrogen-fixing mutualism between Lotus japonicus and Mesorhizobium bacteria. We reconstructed de novo assembled full-genome sequences from nine rhizobial symbionts, finding massive variation in the core genome and the similar symbiotic islands, indicating recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the symbiosis islands into diverse Mesorhizobium lineages. A cross-inoculation experiment using 9 sequenced rhizobial symbionts and 15L. japonicus accessions revealed extensive quality variation represented by plant growth phenotypes, including genotype-by-genotype interactions. Variation in quality was not associated with the presence/absence variation in known symbiosis-related genes in the symbiosis island; rather, it showed significant correlation with the core genome variation. Given the recurrent HGT of the symbiosis islands into diverse Mesorhizobium strains, local Mesorhizobium communities could serve as a major source of variation for core genomes, which might prevent variation in partner quality from fixing, even in the presence of selection favoring high-quality partners. These findings highlight the novel role of HGT of symbiosis islands in maintaining partner quality variation in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis.",33016310
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Soil origin and plant genotype structure distinct microbiome compartments in the model legume Medicago truncatula.,"Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that structure plant microbiomes is necessary for leveraging these interactions to address critical needs in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability. Legumes, which form root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, have served as model plants for understanding the genetics and evolution of beneficial plant-microbe interactions for decades, and thus have added value as models of plant-microbiome interactions. Here we use a common garden experiment with 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to study the drivers of microbiome diversity and composition in three genotypes of the model legume Medicago truncatula grown in two native soil communities. Bacterial diversity decreased between external (rhizosphere) and internal plant compartments (root endosphere, nodule endosphere, and leaf endosphere). Community composition was shaped by strong compartment  soil origin and compartment  plant genotype interactions, driven by significant soil origin effects in the rhizosphere and significant plant genotype effects in the root endosphere. Nevertheless, all compartments were dominated by Ensifer, the genus of rhizobia that forms root nodule symbiosis with M. truncatula, and additional shotgun metagenomic sequencing suggests that the nodulating Ensifer were not genetically distinguishable from those elsewhere in the plant. We also identify a handful of OTUs that are common in nodule tissues, which are likely colonized from the root endosphere. Our results demonstrate strong host filtering effects, with rhizospheres driven by soil origin and internal plant compartments driven by host genetics, and identify several key nodule-inhabiting taxa that coexist with rhizobia in the native range. Our results set the stage for future functional genetic experiments aimed at expanding our pairwise understanding of legume-rhizobium symbiosis toward a more mechanistic understanding of plant microbiomes.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Host-Endosymbiont Genome Integration in a Deep-Sea Chemosymbiotic Clam.,"Endosymbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria has enabled many deep-sea invertebrates to thrive at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, but most previous studies on this mutualism have focused on the bacteria only. Vesicomyid clams dominate global deep-sea chemosynthesis-based ecosystems. They differ from most deep-sea symbiotic animals in passing their symbionts from parent to offspring, enabling intricate coevolution between the host and the symbiont. Here, we sequenced the genomes of the clam Archivesica marissinica (Bivalvia: Vesicomyidae) and its bacterial symbiont to understand the genomic/metabolic integration behind this symbiosis. At 1.52Gb, the clam genome encodes 28 genes horizontally transferred from bacteria, a large number of pseudogenes and transposable elements whose massive expansion corresponded to the timing of the rise and subsequent divergence of symbiont-bearing vesicomyids. The genome exhibits gene family expansion in cellular processes that likely facilitate chemoautotrophy, including gas delivery to support energy and carbon production, metabolite exchange with the symbiont, and regulation of the bacteriocyte population. Contraction in cellulase genes is likely adaptive to the shift from phytoplankton-derived to bacteria-based food. It also shows contraction in bacterial recognition gene families, indicative of suppressed immune response to the endosymbiont. The gammaproteobacterium endosymbiont has a reduced genome of 1.03Mb but retains complete pathways for sulfur oxidation, carbon fixation, and biosynthesis of 20 common amino acids, indicating the host's high dependence on the symbiont for nutrition. Overall, the host-symbiont genomes show not only tight metabolic complementarity but also distinct signatures of coevolution allowing the vesicomyids to thrive in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems.",32956455

Mechanisms generating new gene families include de novo gene birth, horizontal gene transfer, and neofunctionalization following a duplication event. The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is a ubiquitous mutualism and the association has evolved repeatedly and independently many times among the fungi, but the evolutionary dynamics enabling its emergence remain elusive. We developed a phylogenetic workflow to first understand if gene families unique to ECM Amanita fungi and absent from closely related asymbiotic species are functionally relevant to the symbiosis, and then to systematically infer their origins. We identified 109 gene families unique to ECM Amanita species. Genes belonging to unique gene families are under strong purifying selection and are upregulated during symbiosis, compared with genes of conserved or orphan gene families. The origins of seven of the unique gene families are strongly supported as either de novo gene birth (two gene families), horizontal gene transfer (four), or gene duplication (one). An additional 34 families appear new because of their selective retention within symbiotic species. Among the 109 unique gene families, the most upregulated gene in symbiotic cultures encodes a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, an enzyme capable of downregulating the synthesis of the plant hormone ethylene, a common negative regulator of plant-microbial mutualisms.",32926145
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Rediscovering a Forgotten System of Symbiosis: Historical Perspective and Future Potential.,"While the majority of symbiosis research is focused on bacteria, microbial eukaryotes play important roles in the microbiota and as pathogens, especially the incredibly diverse Fungi kingdom. The recent emergence of widespread pathogens in wildlife (bats, amphibians, snakes) and multidrug-resistant opportunists in human populations (<i>Candida auris</i>) has highlighted the importance of better understanding animal-fungus interactions. Regardless of their prominence there are few animal-fungus symbiosis models, but modern technological advances are allowing researchers to utilize novel organisms and systems. Here, I review a forgotten system of animal-fungus interactions: the beetle-fungus symbioses of Drugstore and Cigarette beetles with their symbiont <i>Symbiotaphrina</i>. As pioneering systems for the study of mutualistic symbioses, they were heavily researched between 1920 and 1970, but have received only sporadic attention in the past 40 years. Several features make them unique research organisms, including (1) the symbiont is both extracellular and intracellular during the life cycle of the host, and (2) both beetle and fungus can be cultured in isolation. Specifically, fungal symbionts intracellularly infect cells in the larval and adult beetle gut, while accessory glands in adult females harbor extracellular fungi. In this way, research on the microbiota, pathogenesis/infection, and mutualism can be performed. Furthermore, these beetles are economically important stored-product pests found worldwide. In addition to providing a historical perspective of the research undertaken and an overview of beetle biology and their symbiosis with <i>Symbiotaphrina</i>, I performed two analyses on publicly available genomic data. First, in a preliminary comparative genomic analysis of the fungal symbionts, I found striking differences in the pathways for the biosynthesis of two B vitamins important for the host beetle, thiamine and biotin. Second, I estimated the most recent common ancestor for Drugstore and Cigarette beetles at 8.8-13.5 Mya using sequence divergence (CO1 gene). Together, these analyses demonstrate that modern methods and data (genomics, transcriptomes, etc.) have great potential to transform these beetle-fungus systems into model systems again.",32916942
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular Dialogues between Early Divergent Fungi and Bacteria in an Antagonism versus a Mutualism.,"Fungal-bacterial symbioses range from antagonisms to mutualisms and remain one of the least understood interdomain interactions despite their ubiquity as well as ecological and medical importance. To build a predictive conceptual framework for understanding interactions between fungi and bacteria in different types of symbioses, we surveyed fungal and bacterial transcriptional responses in the mutualism between <i>Rhizopus microsporus</i> (<i>Rm</i>) (ATCC 52813, host) and its <i>Mycetohabitans</i> (formerly <i>Burkholderia</i>) endobacteria versus the antagonism between a nonhost <i>Rm</i> (ATCC 11559) and <i>Mycetohabitans</i> isolated from the host, at two time points, before and after partner physical contact. We found that bacteria and fungi sensed each other before contact and altered gene expression patterns accordingly. <i>Mycetohabitans</i> did not discriminate between the host and nonhost and engaged a common set of genes encoding known as well as novel symbiosis factors. In contrast, responses of the host versus nonhost to endobacteria were dramatically different, converging on the altered expression of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. On the basis of the observed patterns, we formulated a set of hypotheses describing fungal-bacterial interactions and tested some of them. By conducting ROS measurements, we confirmed that nonhost fungi increased production of ROS in response to endobacteria, whereas host fungi quenched their ROS output, suggesting that ROS metabolism contributes to the nonhost resistance to bacterial infection and the host ability to form a mutualism. Overall, our study offers a testable framework of predictions describing interactions of early divergent Mucoromycotina fungi with bacteria.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Animals and plants interact with microbes by engaging specific surveillance systems, regulatory networks, and response modules that allow for accommodation of mutualists and defense against antagonists. Antimicrobial defense responses are mediated in both animals and plants by innate immunity systems that owe their functional similarities to convergent evolution. Like animals and plants, fungi interact with bacteria. However, the principles governing these relations are only now being discovered. In a study system of host and nonhost fungi interacting with a bacterium isolated from the host, we found that bacteria used a common gene repertoire to engage both partners. In contrast, fungal responses to bacteria differed dramatically between the host and nonhost. These findings suggest that as in animals and plants, the genetic makeup of the fungus determines whether bacterial partners are perceived as mutualists or antagonists and what specific regulatory networks and response modules are initiated during each encounter.",32900811
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Origin and elaboration of a major evolutionary transition in individuality.,"Obligate endosymbiosis, in which distantly related species integrate to form a single replicating individual, represents a major evolutionary transition in individuality<sup>1-3</sup>. Although such transitions are thought to increase biological complexity<sup>1,2,4-6</sup>, the evolutionary and developmental steps that lead to integration remain poorly understood. Here we show that obligate endosymbiosis between the bacteria Blochmannia and the hyperdiverse ant tribe Camponotini<sup>7-11</sup> originated and also elaborated through radical alterations in embryonic development, as compared to other insects. The Hox genes AbdominalA (abdA) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx)-which, in arthropods, normally function to differentiate abdominal and thoracic segments after they form-were rewired to also regulate germline genes early in development. Consequently, the mRNAs and proteins of these Hox genes are expressed maternally and colocalize at a subcellular level with those of germline genes in the germplasm and three novel locations in the freshly laid egg. Blochmannia bacteria then selectively regulate these mRNAs and proteins to make each of these four locations functionally distinct, creating a system of coordinates in the embryo in which each location performs a different function to integrate Blochmannia into the Camponotini. Finally, we show that the capacity to localize mRNAs and proteins to new locations in the embryo evolved before obligate endosymbiosis and was subsequently co-opted by Blochmannia and Camponotini. This pre-existing molecular capacity converged with a pre-existing ecological mutualism<sup>12,13</sup> to facilitate both the horizontal transfer<sup>10</sup> and developmental integration of Blochmannia into Camponotini. Therefore, the convergence of pre-existing molecular capacities and ecological interactions-as well as the rewiring of highly conserved gene networks-may be a general feature that facilitates the origin and elaboration of major transitions in individuality.",32879485
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Glycan cross-feeding supports mutualism between Fusobacterium and the vaginal microbiota.,"Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome, are more likely to be colonized by potential pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium linked with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. However, the conditions and mechanisms supporting pathogen colonization during vaginal dysbiosis remain obscure. We demonstrate that sialidase activity, a diagnostic feature of BV, promoted F. nucleatum foraging and growth on mammalian sialoglycans, a nutrient resource that was otherwise inaccessible because of the lack of endogenous F. nucleatum sialidase. In mice with sialidase-producing vaginal microbiotas, mutant F. nucleatum unable to consume sialic acids was impaired in vaginal colonization. These experiments in mice also led to the discovery that F. nucleatum may also ""give back"" to the community by reinforcing sialidase activity, a biochemical feature of human dysbiosis. Using human vaginal bacterial communities, we show that F. nucleatum supported robust outgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, a major sialidase producer and one of the most abundant organisms in BV. These results illustrate that mutually beneficial relationships between vaginal bacteria support pathogen colonization and may help maintain features of dysbiosis. These findings challenge the simplistic dogma that the mere absence of ""healthy"" lactobacilli is the sole mechanism that creates a permissive environment for pathogens during vaginal dysbiosis.

"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular causes of an evolutionary shift along the parasitism-mutualism continuum in a bacterial symbiont.,"Symbiosis with microbes is a ubiquitous phenomenon with a massive impact on all living organisms, shaping the world around us today. Theoretical and experimental studies show that vertical transmission of symbionts leads to the evolution of mutualistic traits, whereas horizontal transmission facilitates the emergence of parasitic features. However, these studies focused on phenotypic data, and we know little about underlying molecular changes at the genomic level. Here, we combined an experimental evolution approach with infection assays, genome resequencing, and global gene expression analysis to study the effect of transmission mode on an obligate intracellular bacterial symbiont. We show that a dramatic shift in the frequency of genetic variants, coupled with major changes in gene expression, allow the symbiont to alter its position in the parasitism-mutualism continuum depending on the mode of between-host transmission. We found that increased parasitism in horizontally transmitted chlamydiae residing in amoebae was a result of processes occurring at the infectious stage of the symbiont's developmental cycle. Specifically, genes involved in energy production required for extracellular survival and the type III secretion system-the symbiont's primary virulence mechanism-were significantly up-regulated. Our results identify the genomic and transcriptional dynamics sufficient to favor parasitic or mutualistic strategies.",32817434

In the Baja California Peninsula, there are two yucca sister species, <i>Y. capensis</i> and <i>Y. valida</i>, that have coevolved with the same pollinator, <i>Tegeticula baja</i>. Both yucca species are endemic to the peninsula, and their current distributions are allopatric. Based on their morphological characteristics, it has been suggested that some plants growing in the southern part of the Magdalena flatland, a spatially disjunct part of <i>Yucca valida</i>'s range, have hybrid origins. We conducted genomic and climatic analyses of the two yucca species as well as the putative hybrid populations. We genotyped 3,423 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 120 individuals sampled from 35 localities. We applied Bayesian tests and geographic cline analyses to the genomic data. Using climatic information from the occurrence sites, we projected species distribution models in different periods to assess changes in the distributional range, and we performed a statistical test to define the niche divergence between the paternal species and the putative hybrid populations. Structure analysis revealed mixed ancestry in the genome of hybrid populations, and the Bayesian models supported a scenario of post-divergence gene flow between the yucca species. Our species distribution models reveal that the geographical ranges of the parental species overlapped mainly during the Last Glacial Maximum, which could facilitate genetic admixture between those species. Finally, we found that most of the assessed environmental axes between the parents and hybrid populations are divergent, indicating that the climatic niche of the hybrid populations is shifting from that of the populations' progenitors. Our results show that the populations in the southern part of the Magdalena flatland are the result of combination of the genetic components of two species. Hybrid individuals with this novel genomic combination arose in a different habitat than their parental species, and they exhibit ecological divergence, which contributes to reproductive isolation through spatial and temporal barriers.",32733491

Recently, miRNAs have been investigated for their potential transfer to distantly related organisms where they may exert regulatory functions in a cross-kingdom fashion. Cross-kingdom miRNA transfer has been observed in host-pathogen relations as well as symbiotic or mutualistic relations. All these can have important implications as plant miRNAs can be exploited to inhibit pathogen development or aid mutualistic relations. Similarly, miRNAs from eukaryotic organisms can be transferred to plants, thus suppressing host immunity. This two-way lane could have a significant impact on understanding inter-species relations and, more importantly, could leverage miRNA-based technologies for agricultural practices. Additionally, artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) produced by engineered plants can be transferred to plant-feeding organisms in order to specifically regulate their cross-kingdom target genes.

Unraveling the bacterial communities associated with fungus-farming ants is essential to understand the role of these microorganisms in the ant-fungus symbiosis. The bacterial community structure of five species of fungus-farmers (non-leaf-cutters; genera Mycocepurus, Mycetarotes, Mycetophylax, and Sericomyrmex) from three different environments in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (lowland forest, restinga forest, and sand dunes) was characterized with amplicon-based Illumina sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Possible differences in bacterial communities between ants internal to the nest (on the fungus garden) and external foragers were also investigated. Our results on the richness and diversity of associated bacteria provide novel evidence that these communities are host- and colony-specific in fungus-farming ants.

Comparing to bacteria, the viral component of the microbiome (i.e., the ""virome"") is understudied. Somatic tissues of healthy individuals are usually inaccessible for the virome sampling; therefore, there is limited understanding of the presence and distribution of viruses in tissues in healthy individuals and how virus infection associates with human gene expression and perturbs immunological homeostasis. To characterize the human virome in a tissue-specific manner, here we performed meta-transcriptomic analysis using the RNA-sequencing dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We analyzed the 8991 RNA-sequencing data obtained from 51 somatic tissues from 547 individuals and successfully detected 39 viral species in at least one tissue. We then investigated associations between virus infection and human gene expression and human disease onset. We detected some expected relationships; for instance, hepatitis C virus infection in the liver was strongly associated with interferon-stimulated gene upregulation and pathological findings of chronic hepatitis. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in one subject's brain strongly associated with immune gene expression. While torque teno virus was detected in a broad range of human tissues, it was not associated with interferon responses. Being notable in light of its association with lymphoproliferative disorders, Epstein-Barr virus infection in the spleen and blood was associated with an increase in plasma cells in healthy subjects. Human herpesvirus 7 was often detected in the stomach; intriguingly, it associated with the proportion of human leukocytes in the stomach as well as digestive gene expression. Moreover, virus infections in the local tissues associated with systemic immune responses in circulating blood. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive investigation of the human virome in a variety of tissues in healthy individuals through meta-transcriptomic analysis. Further investigation of the associations described here, and application of this analytical pipeline to additional datasets, will be useful to reveal the impact of viral infections on human health.",32493363

Here, we used random barcode transposon sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to conduct a genome-wide search for <i>E. coli</i> genes that influence fitness during cooperative growth with <i>R. palustris</i> RB-TnSeq revealed hundreds of genes that increased or decreased <i>E. coli</i> fitness in a mutualism-dependent manner. Some identified genes were involved in nitrogen sensing and assimilation, as expected given the coculture design. The other identified genes were involved in diverse cellular processes, including energy production and cell wall and membrane biogenesis. In addition, we discovered unexpected purine cross-feeding from <i>R. palustris</i> to <i>E. coli</i>, with coculture rescuing growth of an <i>E. coli</i> purine auxotroph. Our data provide insight into the genes and gene networks that can influence a cross-feeding mutualism and underscore that microbial interactions are not necessarily predictable <i>a priori</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbial communities impact life on Earth in profound ways, including driving global nutrient cycles and influencing human health and disease. These community functions depend on the interactions that resident microbes have with the environment and each other. Thus, identifying genes that influence these interactions will aid the management of natural communities and the use of microbial consortia as biotechnology. Here, we identified genes that influenced <i>Escherichia coli</i> fitness during cooperative growth with a mutualistic partner, <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> Although this mutualism centers on the bidirectional exchange of essential carbon and nitrogen, <i>E. coli</i> fitness was positively and negatively affected by genes involved in diverse cellular processes. Furthermore, we discovered an unexpected purine cross-feeding interaction. These results contribute knowledge on the genetic foundation of a microbial cross-feeding interaction and highlight that unanticipated interactions can occur even within engineered microbial communities.",32332139
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Human-microorganism mutualism theory: Possible mechanisms for the delayed chronic wound healing process.,"Skin microbial flora was believed to can implicate skin health, and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the dysbiosis of the microbiome with the disease. Changes of microbiota, including diversity, species, and abundance, have been demonstrated in disease states, and it was believed the changes may cause infection and chronicity of the debilitating wounds. And it was been found a reverse of the dysbiosis after the effective treatment, but it failed to find a positive effect of antibiotic therapy on skin disease without significant clinical infection. The microbiomes were compared to the 'second gene reservoir', and indicated that their co-existing with the human being is a result of co-evolution. The current studies have shown that the microbial community on the skin surface should have an ideal optimal state, which can effectively regulate the immune tolerance and help to avoid the invasion of external pathogenic bacteria, then the body can be in a relatively healthy state. In this paper, we hypothesized that failing to maintain the harmonious relationship between microbes and human beings is the reason we suffering from most skin diseases, including chronic non-healing wounds. Thus, the dysbiosis of skin microbiota theory can help us better understand the mechanism of wound formation and problems encountered in wound treatment.",32298919
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Bacteria-derived diacetyl enhances Arabidopsis phosphate starvation responses partially through the DELLA-dependent gibberellin signaling pathway.,"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are naturally occurring soil microorganisms that colonize roots and stimulate plant growth. Some PGPR strains can directly regulate plant growth in the absence of physical contact with the plant, via volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. Recently, we have described that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> respond differentially to diacetyl, a VOC from <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> strain GB03 (GB03), through integral modulation of the immune system and the phosphate-starvation response (PSR) system, resulting in either mutualism or immunity. Under phosphate deficient conditions, diacetyl enhances salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-mediated immunity and consequently causes plant hyper-sensitivity to phosphate deficiency. Here, we show that application of exogenous gibberellin (GA) partially alleviates the deleterious effect caused by either <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> GB03 VOCs or diacetyl in <i>Arabidopsis</i> under phosphate deficient conditions, while DELLA quadruple mutant exposed to GB03 VOCs exhibits a partial reduction on the stress symptoms. Moreover, diacetyl appears to enhance DELLA protein accumulation and increase the expression of several GA deactivation-related genes. These findings suggest that the DELLA-mediated GA signaling pathway is involved in the <i>bi-faceted</i> role of GB03 VOCs in regulating plant growth.",32183580
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Isotopic and genetic methods reveal the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian host essential amino acid metabolism.,"Intestinal microbiota perform many functions for their host, but among the most important is their role in metabolism, especially the conversion of recalcitrant biomass that the host is unable to digest into bioavailable compounds. Most studies have focused on the assistance gut microbiota provide in the metabolism of carbohydrates, however, their role in host amino acid metabolism is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment on <i>Mus musculus</i> using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids (AA<sub>ESS</sub>) to quantify the community composition of gut microbiota and the contribution of carbohydrate carbon used by the gut microbiome to synthesize AA<sub>ESS</sub> that are assimilated by mice to build skeletal muscle tissue. The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes inversely varied as a function of dietary macromolecular content, with Firmicutes dominating when mice were fed low-protein diets that contained the highest proportions of simple carbohydrates (sucrose). Mixing models estimated that the microbial contribution of AA<sub>ESS</sub> to mouse muscle varied from less than 5% (threonine, lysine, and phenylalanine) to approximately 60% (valine) across diet treatments, with the Firmicute-dominated microbiome associated with the greatest contribution. Our results show that intestinal microbes can provide a significant source of the AA<sub>ESS</sub> their host uses to synthesize structural tissues. The role that gut microbiota play in the amino acid metabolism of animals that consume protein-deficient diets is likely a significant but under-recognized aspect of foraging ecology and physiology.",32126953
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Genetic variation and evolutionary history of a mycorrhizal fungus regulate the currency of exchange in symbiosis with the food security crop cassava.,"Most land plants form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Diversity of AMF increases plant community productivity and plant diversity. For decades, it was known that plants trade carbohydrates for phosphate with their fungal symbionts. However, recent studies show that plant-derived lipids probably represent the most essential currency of exchange. Understanding the regulation of plant genes involved in the currency of exchange is crucial to understanding stability of this mutualism. Plants encounter many different AMF genotypes that vary greatly in the benefit they confer to plants. Yet the role that fungal genetic variation plays in the regulation of this currency has not received much attention. We used a high-resolution phylogeny of one AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis) to show that fungal genetic variation drives the regulation of the plant fatty acid pathway in cassava (Manihot esculenta); a pathway regulating one of the essential currencies of trade in the symbiosis. The regulation of this pathway was explained by clearly defined patterns of fungal genome-wide variation representing the precise fungal evolutionary history. This represents the first demonstrated link between the genetics of AMF and reprogramming of an essential plant pathway regulating the currency of exchange in the symbiosis. The transcription factor RAM1 was also revealed as the dominant gene in the fatty acid plant gene co-expression network. Our study highlights the crucial role of variation in fungal genomes in the trade of resources in this important symbiosis and also opens the door to discovering characteristics of AMF genomes responsible for interactions between AMF and cassava that will lead to optimal cassava growth.",32066875
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",A Critical Mutualism - Competition Interplay Underlies the Loss of Microbial Diversity in Sedentary Lifestyle.,"Physical exercise improves the overall health status by preventing the development of several diseases. In recent years, it has been observed that physical exercise impacts gut microbiota by increasing the presence of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity. In contrast, a sedentary lifestyle increases the incidence of chronic diseases that often have an associated loss of microbial diversity. The gut microbiota is a vast ecosystem in which microorganisms interact with each other in different ways; however, microbial ecosystem interactions are scarcely studied. The goal of this study was to determine whether individuals with a sedentary lifestyle have lower diversity in their gut microbiota and how microbial diversity is associated with changes in bacterial network interactions. For that purpose, diet, body composition, physical activity, and sedentarism behavior were characterized for individuals who did or did not comply with the World Health Organization recommendations for physical activity. The composition of the gut microbiome was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Reorganization of microbial structure with lifestyle was approached from network analysis, where network complexity and the topology of positive and negative interdependences between bacteria were compared and correlated with microbial diversity. Sedentary lifestyle was significantly associated with a diet low in fiber and rich in sugars and processed meat, as well as with high visceral and total corporal fat composition. The diversity (phylogenic diversity, Chao, observed species, and Shannon's index) and network complexity of the gut microbiota were significantly lower in sedentary compared to active individuals. Whereas mutualism or co-occurrence interactions were similar between groups, competitiveness was significantly higher in the active lifestyle group. The mutualism-competition ratio was moderate and positively associated with diversity in sedentary individuals, but not in active individuals. This finding indicates that there is a critical point in this ratio beyond which the stability of the microbial community is lost, inducing a loss of diversity.",32038575
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Phosphatidic acid produced by phospholipase D is required for hyphal cell-cell fusion and fungal-plant symbiosis.,"Although lipid signaling has been shown to serve crucial roles in mammals and plants, little is known about this process in filamentous fungi. Here we analyze the contribution of phospholipase D (PLD) and its product phosphatidic acid (PA) in hyphal morphogenesis and growth of Epichlo festucae and Neurospora crassa, and in the establishment of a symbiotic interaction between E. festucae and Lolium perenne. Growth of E. festucae and N. crassa PLD deletion strains in axenic culture, and for E. festucae in association with L. perenne, were analyzed by light-, confocal- and electron microscopy. Changes in PA distribution were analyzed in E. festucae using a PA biosensor and the impact of these changes on the endocytic recycling and superoxide production investigated. We found that E. festucae PldB, and the N. crassa ortholog, PLA-7, are required for polarized growth and cell fusion and contribute to ascospore development, whereas PldA/PLA-8 are dispensable for these functions. Exogenous addition of PA rescues the cell-fusion phenotype in E. festucae. PldB is also crucial for E. festucae to establish a symbiotic association with L. perenne.

Like pathogens, microbes that establish mutually beneficial relationships with their plant hosts, trigger the induction of some defense responses. Initially, barley colonization by the root endophyte <i>Serendipita indica</i> (syn. <i>Piriformospora indica</i>) is associated with enhanced defense gene expression and the formation of papillae at sites of hyphal penetration attempts. This phenotype is reminiscent of <i>mlo</i>-conditioned immunity in barley leaf tissue and raises the question whether <i>MLO</i> plays a regulatory role in the establishment of beneficial interactions. Here we show that <i>S. indica</i> colonization was significantly reduced in plants carrying <i>mlo</i> mutations compared to wild type controls. The reduction in fungal biomass was associated with the enhanced formation of papillae. Moreover, epidermal cells of <i>S. indica</i>-treated <i>mlo</i> plants displayed an early accumulation of iron in the epidermal layer suggesting increased basal defense activation in the barley mutant background. Correspondingly, the induction of host cell death during later colonization stages was impaired in <i>mlo</i> colonized plants, highlighting the importance of the early biotrophic growth phase for <i>S. indica</i> root colonization. In contrast, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> displayed a similar colonization morphology on mutant and wild type plants. However, the frequency of mycorrhization and number of arbuscules was higher in <i>mlo-</i>5 mutants. These findings suggest that <i>MLO</i> differentially regulates root colonization by endophytic and AM fungi.",32010163
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Bacteriophage lambda overcomes a perturbation in its host-viral genetic network through mutualism and evolution of life history traits.,"An important driver of evolution in viruses is natural selection to optimize the use of their hosts' genetic network. To learn how viruses respond to this pressure, we disrupted the genetic network of Escherichia coli to inhibit replication of its virus, bacteriophage lambda, and then observed how  evolved to compensate. We deleted E. coli's dnaJ gene, which lambda uses to initiate DNA replication. Lambda partially restored its ability to reproduce with just two adaptive mutations associated with genes J and S. The location of the mutations was unexpected because they were not in genes that directly interact with DnaJ, rather they affected seemingly unrelated life history traits. A nonsynonymous J mutation increased lambda's adsorption rate and an S regulatory mutation delayed lysis timing. Lambda also recovered some of its reproductive potential through intracellular mutualism. This study offers two important lessons: first, viruses can rapidly adapt to disruptive changes in their host's genetic network. Second, organisms can employ mechanisms thought to operate at the population scale, such as evolution of life history traits and social interactions, in order to overcome hurdles at the molecular level. As life science research progresses and new fields become increasingly specialized, these results remind us of the importance of multiscale and interdisciplinary approaches to understand adaptation.",31891185

Additionally, patterns of genetic variation in interacting species can reveal ecological traits that are important to gene flow and co-evolution. In this study, we define patterns of spatial and temporal genetic variation of a coral reef fish, <i>Siphamia tubifer</i>, and its luminous bacterial symbiont, <i>Photobacterium mandapamensis</i> in the Okinawa Islands, Japan. Using restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods, we show that populations of the facultative light organ symbiont of <i>S. tubifer</i> exhibit genetic structure at fine spatial scales of tens of kilometers despite the absence of physical barriers to dispersal and in contrast to populations of the host fish. These results suggest that the host's behavioral ecology and environmental interactions between host and symbiont help to structure symbiont populations in the region, consequently fostering the specificity of the association between host generations. Our approach also revealed several symbiont genes that were divergent between host populations, including <i>hfq</i> and a homolog of <i>varS</i>, both of which play a role in host association in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Overall, this study highlights the important role that a host animal can play in structuring the distribution of its bacterial symbiont, particularly in highly connected marine environments, thereby promoting specificity of the symbiosis between host generations.",31824455
"""mutualism"" AND ""gene""",Efficient but occasionally imperfect vertical transmission of gut mutualistic protists in a wood-feeding termite.,"Although mutualistic associations between animals and microbial symbionts are widespread in nature, the mechanisms that have promoted their evolutionary persistence remain poorly understood. A vertical mode of symbiont transmission (from parents to offspring) is thought to ensure partner fidelity and stabilization, although the efficiency of vertical transmission has rarely been investigated, especially in cases where hosts harbour a diverse microbial community. Here we evaluated vertical transmission rates of cellulolytic gut oxymonad and parabasalid protists in the wood-feeding termite Reticulitermes grassei. We sequenced amplicons of the 18S rRNA gene of protists from 24 colonies of R.grassei collected in two populations. For each colony, the protist community was characterized from the gut of 14 swarming reproductives and from a pool of 10 worker guts. A total of 98 operational taxonomic units belonging to 13 species-level taxa were found. The vertical transmission rate was estimated for each protist present in a colony based on its frequency among the reproductives. The results revealed that transmission rates were high, with an average of 0.897 (0.164) per protist species. Overall, the protist community did not differ between reproductive sexes, suggesting that both the queen and the king could contribute to the gut microbiota of the offspring. A positive relationship between the transmission rate of protists and their prevalence within populations was also detected. However, transmission rates alone do not explain the prevalence ofprotists. In conclusion, these findings reveal key forces behind a conserved, multispecies mutualism, raising further questions on the roles of horizontal transfer and negative selection in shaping symbiont prevalence.",31788887
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Phenotypic heterogeneity of capsule production across opportunistic pathogens.,"Phenotypic heterogeneity allows bacteria to adapt fast to changing environments. Extracellular capsules are well-known virulence factors, but also increase the cell adaptability and prevalence under hostile conditions. To limit their cost, some species regulate capsule production by genetic phase variation. Here, we demonstrated that phenotypic heterogeneity is a major mechanism controlling capsule production in <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> species. We designed a method to agnostically measure heterogeneity and show that 71% of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> strains can be heterogeneous. This is mostly associated with <i>K. pneumoniae</i> strains that do not encode <i>rmp</i>, a genetic determinant of hypervirulence. Capsule serotype exchanges across several genetic backgrounds revealed that heterogeneity depends on specific genome-capsule locus interactions. Importantly, we showed that heterogeneity provides a fitness advantage especially in conditions where the capsule is costly, as estimated by comparing non-heterogeneous and heterogeneous strains during competition with their non-capsulated variants. Finally, heterogeneity impacts phage adsorption patterns, and could thus alter the rate of horizontal gene transfer events. This unsuspected heterogeneity may help understand the transition from commensalism to pathogenesis and can have important implications in virulence, environmental survival and evolution of some ESKAPE pathogens.IMPORTANCEThe polysaccharidic capsule is present in ~50% of species across the bacterial phylogeny, including all ESKAPE microorganisms, the six most significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial pathogens. It is also an important virulence factor and a major target for both phage therapy and the development of vaccines. Here, we reveal that in two major genera of ESKAPE pathogens, <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. and <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp., capsule production within clonal populations is heterogeneous, leading to mixed populations of hyper-, hypo-, and intermediate-capsulated cells. Such heterogeneity responds to different environmental cues, including changes in nutrient availability and spatial structure. We show that this plasticity, known to enable faster, more efficient adaptation to environmental changes, limits capsule costs and could explain <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> resilience. Finally, capsule heterogeneity can play a major role in bacterial evolution, as a driver of horizontal gene transfer, and in treatment failure. Thus, it should be taken into account in the design of prophylactic strategies and antimicrobial therapy.",40905702
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Coordinated regulation of pH alkalinization by two transcription factors promotes fungal commensalism and pathogenicity.,"As a clinically relevant opportunistic human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans is able to rapidly sense and adapt to changing microenvironments within the host, a process that is essential for its successful invasion and survival. Although studies have shown that the transcription factor Stp2 is the master regulator of environmental alkalinization, accumulating evidence supports a clear involvement of other participants in this adaptation process. Here, following a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor Dal81 as an uncharacterized positive regulator of pH alkalinization in C. albicans. Dal81 influences the protein levels of Stp2. A mutant lacking DAL81 also fails to alkalinize both in vitro and in the phagolysosome, and this defective phenotype is further enhanced by deleting both factors in most cases. Notably, our results demonstrate that Dal81 physically interacts with Stp2 to co-regulate the expression of a broad set of downstream target genes related to metabolism of organic acids, oxoacids, carboxylic acids and amino acids. This coordinated regulation mode is required for the alkalinization process and plays a role in modulating commensalism and pathogenicity of C. albicans. Taken together, our findings elucidate the cooperative function of Dal81 with Stp2 in the nucleus to orchestrate the expression of downstream genes required for the survival and propagation of C. albicans in the host.",40846842

The current study further investigated the physiological and genomic responses of these birds to elucidate the potential mechanisms behind the reduction of Campylobacter observed in the ceca. The quantification of the relative abundances of selected bacterial communities in the ceca and the expression of immune-related genes in the cecal mucosa, cecal tonsils, spleen and liver was performed using qPCR. Histomorphology of the ceca was analysed by PAS staining method. The serum immunoglobulin Y (IgY) content was quantified using an ELISA method. Both treatments reduced the abundance of Akkermansia sp. and the probiotic treatment reduced Bifidobacterium sp. in the ceca of Campylobacter infected chickens when compared to the control birds (in-ovo injected with physiological saline). A higher innate immune defence response was observed through gene expression in the cecal tonsils and spleen of the in-ovo stimulated birds when compared to the control birds. The villus width and crypt depth were decreased in the in-ovo stimulated groups when compared to the control group while the serum IgY content did not differ between the groups. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that in-ovo stimulation can be an effective method in innate immunity training to control Campylobacter jejuni in broiler chickens.",40483907
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Archaeogenomic insights into commensalism and regional variation in pig management in Neolithic northwest Europe.,"The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched <sup>15</sup>N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant <i>Sus scrofa</i> suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH. We further show selection signatures, associated with coat color and behavior, in Neolithic herds despite recurrent wild gene flow. Altogether, our results show distinct husbandry practices through space and time in Neolithic Europe, with heavy reliance on boar recruitment via the commensal pathway in northwest Europe.",40096601

In various contexts, plants and microorganisms engage in mutually beneficial partnerships that enhance crop health and maintain balance in ecosystems. However, these associations also render plants susceptible to a range of pathogens. Understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms governing these associations is crucial, given the notable susceptibility of plants to external environmental influences.

This review explores the multifaceted relationships between plants and their associated microorganisms, encompassing mutualism, commensalism, and antagonism. The molecular mechanisms of symbiotic and pathogenic interactions share similarities but lead to different outcomes. While symbiosis benefits both parties, pathogenesis harms the host. Genetic adaptations optimize these interactions, involving coevolution driving process.

The common myna (Acridotheres tristis) has been introduced to over a dozen countries and is classified as one of the most invasive birds in the world. Their multiple invasions provide an opportunity to identify repeated adaptation, as invasive populations originated from multiple source populations. We compared whole-genome resequencing data from 80 individuals from four native and seven invasive populations, representing two independent introduction pathways. Results from two different selection scan methods were combined and identified a strongly selected region on chromosome 8 that spans two copies of AMY2A, part of the alpha-amylase gene family, a putative ncRNA and an insertion-deletion structural variant (SV) that contains an ERVK transposable element (TE). Outlier SNPs and the SV are polymorphic in native populations, but fixed or close-to-fixed in the two invasive pathways, with the fixation of the same alleles in two independent lineages providing evidence for parallel selection on standing variation. Intriguingly, the second copy of AMY2A has a non-conservative missense mutation at a phylogenetically conserved site. This mutation, alongside variation in the SV, TE and ncRNA, provide possible routes for changes to protein function or expression. AMY2A has been associated with human commensalism in house sparrows, and genes in this family have been linked to adaptation to high-starch diets in humans and dogs.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Transcriptional profiling reveals the role of Candida albicans Rap1 in oxidative stress response.,"Candida albicans is a member of the human commensal microbiota but can also cause opportunistic infections, including life-threatening invasive candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. One of the important features of C. albicans commensalism and virulence is its ability to adapt to diverse environmental stress conditions within the host. Rap1 is a DNA-binding protein identified in yeasts, protozoa, and mammalian cells, and it plays multiple functions, including telomere regulation. Intriguingly, our previous study showed that Rap1 is also involved in cell wall integrity, biofilm formation, and virulence in C. albicans. In this work, using RNA-seq analysis and other approaches, the role of C. albicans Rap1 in oxidative stress response was further revealed. The RAP1-deletion mutant exhibited greater resistance to the superoxide generator menadione, a lower level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon menadione treatment, and higher expression levels of superoxide dismutase genes, all in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, the association between Rap1-mediated oxidative stress response and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Hog1, the transcription factor Cap1 and the TOR signalling was also determined.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Exceptions to the rule: When does resistance evolution not undermine antibiotic therapy in human bacterial infections?,"The use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections often imposes strong selection for antibiotic resistance. However, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance varies greatly across different combinations of pathogens and drugs. What underlies this variation? Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and literature surveys capable of integrating data across many studies have tried to answer this question, but the vast majority of these studies have focused only on cases where resistance is common or problematic. Yet much could presumably be learned from the cases where resistance is infrequent or absent. Here we conducted a literature survey and a systematic review to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance across a wide range of pathogen-by-drug combinations (57 pathogens and 53 antibiotics from 15 drug classes). Using Akaike information criterion-based model selection and model-averaged parameter estimation we explored 14 different factors posited to be associated with resistance evolution. We find that the most robust predictors of high resistance are nosocomial transmission (i.e., hospital-acquired pathogens) and indirect transmission (e.g., vector-, water-, air-, or vehicle-borne pathogens). While the former was to be expected based on prior studies, the positive correlation between high resistance frequencies and indirect transmission is, to our knowledge, a novel insight. The most robust predictor of low resistance is zoonosis from wild animal reservoirs. We also found partial support that resistance was associated with pathogen type, horizontal gene transfer, commensalism, and human-to-human transmission. We did not find support for correlations between resistance and environmental reservoirs, mechanisms of drug action, and global drug use. This work explores the relative explanatory power of various pathogen and drug factors on resistance evolution, which is necessary to identify priority targets of stewardship efforts to slow the spread of drug-resistant pathogens.",39100236

In this study, the bacterial diversity and core members of the dinoflagellate-associated microbiota were defined from 11 strains of three epibenthic Prorocentrum species, representing three geographically disjunct locations within Mexican coastal waters. Microbiota profiles in stable monoclonal Prorocentrum cultures were obtained by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Thirteen classes of bacteria were identified among dinoflagellate clones, where Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia were consistently dominant. The bacterial community structure exhibited significantly different grouping by the location of origin of dinoflagellate clones. No significant diversity difference was found among free-living or unattached bacteria in the dinoflagellate culture medium (M) compared with those in closer association with the dinoflagellate host cells (H). Twelve taxa were defined as core members of the bacterial assemblage, representing the genera Algiphilus, Cohaesibacter, Labrenzia, Mameliella, Marinobacter, Marivita, Massilia, Muricauda, Roseitalea, and an unclassified member of the Rhodobacteraceae. The core members are inferred to significantly contribute to primary and secondary metabolic functions, but no direct correlation with dinoflagellate toxigenicity was apparent. Overall the bacterial profile and implied gene functionality indicated a suite of positive interactions, suggesting either mutualism or commensalism with the dinoflagellate.

They are characterized by a distinct gene expression profile and can be stably maintained through <i>in vitro</i> passaging or <i>in vivo</i> inhabitation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mice. Remarkably, the majority of the <i>efg1</i> mutant cells become rod cells in N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-containing medium, and the GlcNAc sensor Ngs1 is instrumental in converting the white or gray cells to the rod cells. Conversely, glucose inhibits rod cells through Cph1; consequently, the loss of Cph1 in the <i>efg1</i> mutant cells permits their conversion to rod cells in glucose-replete media. Notably, rod cells of the <i>efg1</i>/ <i>cph1</i> mutant display superior adaptation and longer persistence in the murine GI environment than wild-type white cells. Taken together, these findings establish rod cells as a previously unappreciated form that is not only morphologically and transcriptionally distinguishable but also defined by specific genetic and environmental determinants, shedding light on complex fungus-host interactions.",38887798

To reflect global operon integrity, contiguity, duplication, and fragmentation principles, we propose a six-category (infra/supra-numerary) cataloging system and a Global Operon Profiling System for bacteria. Mechanistically, genomic sequence analyses revealed that operon fragmentation is driven by intra-operon insertions of predominantly <i>Bacteroides</i>-DNA (<i>thetaiotaomicron/fragilis</i>) and likely natural selection in gut-wall specific micro-niches or micropathologies. <i>Bacteroides</i>-insertions, also detected in other antigenic operons (fimbriae), but not in operons deemed essential (ribosomal), could explain why <i>Bacteroidota</i> have fewer KEGG-pathways despite large genomes.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Tuning interdomain conjugation to enable <i>in situ</i> population modification in yeasts.,"The ability to modify and control natural and engineered microbiomes is essential for biotechnology and biomedicine. Fungi are critical members of most microbiomes, yet technology for modifying the fungal members of a microbiome has lagged far behind that for bacteria. Interdomain conjugation (IDC) is a promising approach, as DNA transfer from bacterial cells to yeast enables <i>in situ</i> modification. While such genetic transfers have been known to naturally occur in a wide range of eukaryotes and are thought to contribute to their evolution, IDC has been understudied as a technique to control fungal or fungal-bacterial consortia. One major obstacle to the widespread use of IDC is its limited efficiency. In this work, we manipulated metabolic and physical interactions between genetically tractable <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to control the incidence of IDC. We test the landscape of population interactions between the bacterial donors and yeast recipients to find that bacterial commensalism leads to maximized IDC, both in culture and in mixed colonies. We demonstrate the capacity of cell-to-cell binding via mannoproteins to assist both IDC incidence and bacterial commensalism in culture and model how these tunable controls can predictably yield a range of IDC outcomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these controls can be utilized to irreversibly alter a recipient yeast population, by both ""rescuing"" a poor-growing recipient population and collapsing a stable population via a novel IDC-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system.IMPORTANCEFungi are important but often unaddressed members of most natural and synthetic microbial communities. This work highlights opportunities for modifying yeast microbiome populations through bacterial conjugation. While conjugation has been recognized for its capacity to deliver engineerable DNA to a range of cells, its dependence on cell contact has limited its efficiency. Here, we find ""knobs"" to control DNA transfer, by engineering the metabolic dependence between bacterial donors and yeast recipients and by changing their ability to physically adhere to each other. Importantly, we functionally validate these ""knobs"" by irreversibly altering yeast populations. We use these controls to ""rescue"" a failing yeast population, demonstrate the capacity of conjugated CRISPR/Cas9 to depress or collapse populations, and show that conjugation can be easily interrupted by disrupting cell-to-cell binding.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Bacteria-derived short-chain fatty acids as potential regulators of fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.,"The human gastrointestinal microbiome encompasses bacteria, fungi, and viruses forming complex bionetworks which, for organismal health, must be in a state of homeostasis. An important homeostatic mechanism derives from microbial competition, which maintains the relative abundance of microbial species in a healthy balance. Microbes compete for nutrients and secrete metabolites that inhibit other microbes. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are one such class of metabolites made by gut bacteria to very high levels. SCFAs are metabolised by microbes and host cells and have multiple roles in regulating cell physiology. Here, we review the mechanisms by which SCFAs regulate the fungal gut commensal Candida albicans. We discuss SCFA's ability to inhibit fungal growth, limit invasive behaviours and modulate cell surface antigens recognised by immune cells. We review the mechanisms underlying these roles: regulation of gene expression, metabolism, signalling and SCFA-driven post-translational protein modifications by acylation, which contribute to changes in acylome dynamics of C. albicans with potentially large consequences for cell physiology. Given that the gut mycobiome is a reservoir for systemic disease and has also been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease, understanding the mechanisms by which bacterial metabolites, such as SCFAs, control the mycobiome might provide therapeutic avenues.",38729839

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",- Invited Review - Chemical signalling within the rumen microbiome.,"Ruminants possess a specialized four-compartment forestomach, consisting of the reticulum, rumen, omasum, and abomasum. The rumen, the primary fermentative chamber, harbours a dynamic ecosystem comprising bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and bacteriophages. These microorganisms engage in diverse ecological interactions within the rumen microbiome, primarily benefiting the host animal by deriving energy from plant material breakdown. These interactions encompass symbiosis, such as mutualism and commensalism, as well as parasitism, predation, and competition. These ecological interactions are dependent on many factors, including the production of diverse molecules, such as those involved in quorum sensing (QS). QS is a density-dependent signalling mechanism involving the release of autoinducer (AIs) compounds, when cell density increases AIs bind to receptors causing the altered expression of certain genes. These AIs are classified as mainly being N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL; commonly used by Gram-negative bacteria) or autoinducer-2 based systems (AI-2; used by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria); although other less common AI systems exist. Most of our understanding of QS at a gene-level comes from pure culture in vitro studies using bacterial pathogens, with much being unknown on a commensal bacterial and ecosystem level, especially in the context of the rumen microbiome. A small number of studies have explored QS in the rumen using 'omic' technologies, revealing a prevalence of AI-2 QS systems among rumen bacteria. Nevertheless, the implications of these signalling systems on gene regulation, rumen ecology, and ruminant characteristics are largely uncharted territory. Metatranscriptome data tracking the colonization of perennial ryegrass by rumen microbes suggest that these chemicals may influence transitions in bacterial diversity during colonization. The likelihood of undiscovered chemicals within the rumen microbial arsenal is high, with the identified chemicals representing only the tip of the iceberg. A comprehensive grasp of rumen microbial chemical signalling is crucial for addressing the challenges of food security and climate targets.",38186253

Although GlcNAc catabolism is beneficial for commensal growth of C. albicans, deleting GlcNAc sensor-transducer Ngs1 confers enhanced fitness, indicating that GlcNAc signaling is detrimental to commensalism. Interestingly, addition of GlcNAc attenuates commensal fitness of gut-evolved C. albicans but retains its disease-causing potential. We further demonstrate that GlcNAc is a major inducer of hypha-associated transcription in the gut, which represents the key determinant for commensal-pathogenic equilibrium. In addition to yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis, we also identify other factors, including Sod5 and Ofi1, that contribute to the balance.

We demonstrate that high iron specifically triggers multiple post-translational modifications and proteasomal degradation of Hap43, a vital process guaranteeing the precision of intestinal ROS detoxification. Reduced levels of Hap43 de-repress the expression of antioxidant genes and therefore alleviate the deleterious ROS derived from iron metabolism.

We hypothesize that this is due to the lower growth yield of anaerobes compared to aerobic microorganisms. In this work, we aim at evaluating whether the anaerobic bacterial community represents a relevant fraction of the biodiversity of the cryoconite and at describing its structure and functions. We collected sediment samples from cryoconite holes on the Forni Glacier (Italy) and sequenced both 16S rRNA amplicon genes and 16S rRNA amplicon transcripts at different times of the day along a clear summer day. Results showed that a relevant fraction of taxa has been detected only by 16S rRNA transcripts and was undetectable in 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Furthermore, in the transcript approach, anaerobic taxa were overrepresented compared with DNA sequencing. The metatranscriptomics approach was used also to investigate the expression of the main metabolic functions. Results showed the occurrence of syntrophic and commensalism relationships among fermentative bacteria, hydrogenothrophs, and consumers of fermentation end products, which have never been reported so far in cryoconite. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Recent evidence disclosed the presence of a potential niche for anaerobic microorganisms and anaerobic processes in supraglacial sediments (cryoconite), but a detailed description of the structure and functions of the anaerobic population is still lacking.

We examined growth of the <i>orf19.217</i> knockout-mutant in different hypha-inducing conditions and found that the mutant still formed hyphae under standard hypha-inducing conditions. To further investigate the function of Orf19.217 in <i>C. albicans</i>, we combined genome-wide expression (RNA-Seq) and location (ChIP-Seq) analyses. We found that Orf19.217 is involved in regulatory processes comprising hyphal morphogenesis and iron acquisition. Comparative analysis with existing <i>C. albicans</i> hyphal transcriptomes indicates that Orf19.217-mediated filamentation is distinct from a true hyphal program. Further, the <i>orf19.217</i> knockout-mutant did not show increased sensitivity to iron deprivation, but <i>ORF19.217</i> overexpression was able to rescue the growth of a <i>hap5</i>-mutant, defective in a subunit of the CCAAT-complex, which is essential for iron acquisition. This suggested that Orf19.217 is involved in regulation of iron acquisition genes during iron deprivation and acts in a parallel pathway to the established CCAAT-complex. Interestingly, the <i>orf19.217</i>-mutant turned out to be defective in its ability to form filaments under iron-deficiency. Taken together our findings propose that the transcription factor Orf19.217 stimulates expression of the hyphal regulators <i>EFG1</i> and <i>BRG1</i> to promote filamentous growth under iron deprivation conditions, allowing the fungus to escape these iron-depleted conditions. The transcription factor therefore appears to be particularly important for adaptation of <i>C. albicans</i> to diverse environmental conditions in the human host. In regard to the newly identified functions, we have given the regulator the name Irf1, Iron-dependent Regulator of Filamentation.",36004328

We sought to determine alterations of the microbial composition in the nasal mucus of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and to elucidate the interplay between dysbiosis of the nasal microbiome and allergic inflammation. In total, 364,923 high-quality bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding gene sequence reads from 104 middle turbinate mucosa samples from healthy participants and patients with AR were obtained and analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology pipeline. We analyzed the microbiota in samples of nasal mucus from patients with AR (n=42) and clinically healthy participants (n=30). The Proteobacteria (Ralstonia genus) and Actinobacteria (Propionibacterium genus) phyla were predominant in the nasal mucus of healthy subjects, whereas the Firmicutes (Staphylococcus genus) phylum was significantly abundant in the nasal mucus of patients with AR. In particular, the Ralstonia genus was significantly dominant in the clinically healthy subjects. Additional pyrosequencing data from 32 subjects (healthy participants: n=15, AR patients: n=17) revealed a greater abundance of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium accolens, and Nocardia coeliaca, accounting for 41.55% of mapped sequences in the nasal mucus of healthy participants. Dysbiosis of the nasal microbiome was more pronounced in patients with AR, and Staphylococcus aureus exhibited the greatest abundance (37.69%) in their nasal mucus, in association with a positive response to house dust mites and patients' age and height. This study revealed alterations in the nasal microbiome in the nasal mucus of patients with AR at the levels of microbial genera and species. S. aureus-dominant dysbiosis was distinctive in the nasal mucus of patients with AR, suggesting a role of host-microbial commensalism in allergic inflammation.",35680131
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Candida albicans oscillating UME6 expression during intestinal colonization primes systemic Th17 protective immunity.,"Systemic immunity is stringently regulated by commensal intestinal microbes, including the pathobiont Candida albicans. This fungus utilizes various transcriptional and morphological programs for host adaptation, but how this heterogeneity affects immunogenicity remains uncertain. We show that UME6, a transcriptional regulator of filamentation, is essential for intestinal C. albicans-primed systemic Th17 immunity. UME6 deletion and constitutive overexpression strains are non-immunogenic during commensal colonization, whereas immunogenicity is restored by C. albicans undergoing oscillating UME6 expression linked with -glucan and mannan production. In turn, intestinal reconstitution with these fungal cell wall components restores protective Th17 immunity to mice colonized with UME6-locked variants. These fungal cell wall ligands and commensal C. albicans stimulate Th17 immunity through multiple host pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2, which work synergistically for colonization-induced protection. Thus, dynamic gene expression fluctuations by C. albicans during symbiotic colonization are essential for priming host immunity against disseminated infection.",35584674
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Neisseria genes required for persistence identified via in vivo screening of a transposon mutant library.,"The mechanisms used by human adapted commensal Neisseria to shape and maintain a niche in their host are poorly defined. These organisms are common members of the mucosal microbiota and share many putative host interaction factors with Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Evaluating the role of these shared factors during host carriage may provide insight into bacterial mechanisms driving both commensalism and asymptomatic infection across the genus. We identified host interaction factors required for niche development and maintenance through in vivo screening of a transposon mutant library of Neisseria musculi, a commensal of wild-caught mice which persistently and asymptomatically colonizes the oral cavity and gut of CAST/EiJ and A/J mice. Approximately 500 candidate genes involved in long-term host interaction were identified. These included homologs of putative N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae virulence factors which have been shown to modulate host interactions in vitro. Importantly, many candidate genes have no assigned function, illustrating how much remains to be learned about Neisseria persistence. Many genes of unknown function are conserved in human adapted Neisseria species; they are likely to provide a gateway for understanding the mechanisms allowing pathogenic and commensal Neisseria to establish and maintain a niche in their natural hosts. Validation of a subset of candidate genes confirmed a role for a polysaccharide capsule in N. musculi persistence but not colonization. Our findings highlight the potential utility of the Neisseria musculi-mouse model as a tool for studying the pathogenic Neisseria; our work represents a first step towards the identification of novel host interaction factors conserved across the genus.",35580146

Despite the increasing recognition of linkages between bacterioplankton and dynamics of dinoflagellate blooms in the field, knowledge about the forms and functions of dinoflagellate-bacteria associations remains elusive, mainly due to the ephemeral and variable conditions in the field. In this study, we characterized the bacterial community associated with laboratory cultures of 144 harmful algal strains, including 130 dinoflagellates (covering all major taxonomic orders of dinoflagellates) and 14 non-dinoflagellates, via high-throughput sequencing for 16S rRNA gene amplicons. A total of 4577 features belonging to bacteria kingdom comprising of 24 phyla, 55 classes, 134 orders, 273 families, 716 genera, and 1104 species were recovered from the algal culture collection, and 3 phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) were universally present in all the culture samples. Bacterial communities in dinoflagellates cultures exhibited remarkable conservation across different algal strains, which were dominated by a relatively small number of taxa, most notably the <i></i>-proteobacteria <i>Methylophaga</i>, <i>Marinobacter</i> and <i>Alteromonas</i>. Although the bacterial community composition between dinoflagellates and non-dinoflagellate groups did not show significant difference in general, dinoflagellates harbored a large number of unique features (up to 3811) with relatively low individual abundance and enriched in the potential methylotrophs <i>Methylophaga.</i> While the bacterial assemblages associated with thecate and athecate dinoflagellates displayed no general difference in species composition and functional groups, athecate dinoflagellates appeared to accommodate more aerobic cellulolytic members of Actinobacteria, implying a more possible reliance on cellulose utilization as energy source. The extensive co-occurrence discovered here implied that the relationships between these algal species and the bacterial consortia could be viewed as either bilaterally beneficial (i.e., mutualism) or unilaterally beneficial at least to one party but virtually harmless to the other party (i.e., commensalism), whereas both scenarios support a long-term and stable co-existence rather than an exclusion of one or the other. Our results demonstrated that dinoflagellates-associated bacterial communities were similar in composition, with enrichment of potential uncultured methylotrophs to one-carbon compounds. This work enriches the knowledge about the fundamental functions of bacteria consortia associated with the phycospheres of dinoflagellates and other HABs-forming microalgae.",35457312

To fulfill dietary requirements, ants have established commensalism with both sap-feeding insects and bacteria. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to characterize the bacterial composition and structure of the digestive tracts in three species of <i>Formica</i> ants and <i>Lasius niger</i> (Linnaeus)-species that predominantly feed on honeydew secreted by aphids. We found that bacterial communities displayed species- and colony-level signatures, and that bacterial communities in the infrabuccal pockets and crops were different from those in the midguts and hindguts. <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Wolbachia</i> were dominant in the infrabuccal pockets and crops of workers, whereas <i>Wolbachia</i> was dominant in the midguts, hindguts and brood (larvae, pupae and cocoons). To learn more about the dominant <i>Lactobacillus</i> in ants, we assessed its prevalence in a wide range of aphid-tending ants using diagnostic PCR. We found that <i>Lactobacillus</i> was more prevalent in Formicinae than in Myrmicinae species. We also isolated four strains of lactic acid bacteria (<i>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</i>, <i>Lactobacillus lindneri</i>, <i>Weissella cibaria</i> and <i>Fructobacillus</i> sp.) from the infrabuccal pockets and crops of aphid-tending ants using a culture-dependent method. Two predominant lactic acid bacterial isolates, <i>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</i> (La2) and <i>Weissella cibaria</i> (La3), exhibited abilities in catabolizing sugars (sucrose, trehalose, melezitose and raffinose) known to be constituents of hemipteran honeydew.

Thus, the World Health Organization developed a One-Health surveillance project called Tricycle focusing on the prevalence of ESBL-producing <i>Escherichia</i> co<i>li</i> in humans, animals, and the environment. Here we present the first results of the human community component of Tricycle in Madagascar. From July 2018 to April 2019, rectal swabs from 492 pregnant women from Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Ambatondrazaka, and Toamasina were tested for ESBL-<i>E. coli</i> carriage. Demographic, sociological and environmental risk factors were investigated, and <i>E. coli</i> isolates were characterized (antibiotic susceptibility, resistance and virulence genes, plasmids, and genomic diversity). ESBL-<i>E. coli</i> prevalence carriage in pregnant women was 34% varying from 12% (Toamasina) to 65% (Ambatondrazaka). The main risk factor associated with ESBL<i>-E. coli</i> carriage was the rainy season (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-5.6, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Whole genome sequencing was performed on 168 isolates from 144 participants. <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M-15</sub> was the most frequent ESBL gene (86%). One isolate was resistant to carbapenems and carried the <i>bla</i> <sub><i>NDM-</i>5</sub> gene. Most isolates belonged to commensalism associated phylogenetic groups A, B1, and C (90%) and marginally to extra-intestinal virulence associated phylogenetic groups B2, D and F (10%). Multi locus sequence typing showed 67 different sequence types gathered in 17 clonal complexes (STc), the most frequent being STc10/phylogroup A (35%), followed distantly by the emerging STc155/phylogroup B1 (7%), STc38/phylogroup D (4%) and STc131/phylogroup B2 (3%). While a wide diversity of clones has been observed, SNP analysis revealed several genetically close isolates (<i>n</i> = 34/168) which suggests human-to-human transmissions. IncY plasmids were found with an unusual prevalence (23%), all carrying a <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M-15</sub>. Most of them (85%) showed substantial homology (85%) suggesting a dissemination of IncY ESBL plasmids in Madagascar. This large-scale study reveals a high prevalence of ESBL-<i>E. coli</i> among pregnant women in four cities in Madagascar associated with warmth and rainfall. It shows the great diversity of <i>E. coli</i> disseminating throughout the country but also transmission of specific clones and spread of plasmids.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Detection of a novel enterotropic Mycoplasma gallisepticum-like in European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) around poultry farms in France.,"Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in southwest France have raised questions regarding the role of commensal wild birds in the introduction and dissemination of pathogens between poultry farms. To assess possible infectious contacts at the wild-domestic bird interface, the presence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) was studied in the two sympatric compartments in southwest France. Among various peridomestic wild birds (n=385), standard PCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA of MG showed a high apparent prevalence (up to 45%) in cloacal swabs of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris, n=108), while the MG-specific mgc2 gene was not detected. No tracheal swab of these birds tested positive, and no clinical sign was observed in positive birds, suggesting commensalism in the digestive tract of starlings. A mycoplasma strain was then isolated from a starling swab and its whole genome was sequenced using both Illumina and Nanopore technologies. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to MG and M. tullyi, although it was a distinct species. A pair of specific PCR primers targeting the mgc2-like gene of this MG-like strain was designed and used to screen again the same avian populations and a wintering urban population of starlings (n=50). Previous PCR results obtained in starlings were confirmed to be mostly due to this strain (20/22 positive pools). In contrast, the strain was not detected in fresh faeces of urban starlings. Furthermore, it was detected in one cloacal pool of white wagtails, suggesting infectious transmissions between synanthropic birds with similar feeding behaviour. As the new Starling mycoplasma was not detected in free-range ducks (n=80) in close contact with positive starlings, nor in backyard (n=320) and free-range commercial (n=720) chickens of the area, it might not infect poultry. However, it could be involved in mycoplasma gene transfer in such multi-species contexts.",34738732
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Modelling evolutionary pathways for commensalism and hypervirulence in <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>.,"<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, the meningococcus<i>,</i> resides exclusively in humans and causes invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). The population of <i>N. meningitidis</i> is structured into stable clonal complexes by limited horizontal recombination in this naturally transformable species. <i>N. meningitidis</i> is an opportunistic pathogen, with some clonal complexes, such as cc53, effectively acting as commensal colonizers, while other genetic lineages, such as cc11, are rarely colonizers but are over-represented in IMD and are termed hypervirulent. This study examined theoretical evolutionary pathways for pathogenic and commensal lineages by examining the prevalence of horizontally acquired genomic islands (GIs) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. Using a collection of 4850 genomes from the BIGSdb database, we identified 82 GIs in the pan-genome of 11 lineages (10 hypervirulent and one commensal lineage). A new computational tool, Phaser, was used to identify frameshift mutations, which were examined for statistically significant association with genetic lineage. Phaser identified a total of 144 frameshift loci of which 105 were shown to have a statistically significant non-random distribution in phase status. The 82 GIs, but not the LOF loci, were associated with genetic lineage and invasiveness using the disease carriage ratio metric. These observations have been integrated into a new model that infers the early events of the evolution of the human adapted meningococcus. These pathways are enriched for GIs that are involved in modulating attachment to the host, growth rate, iron uptake and toxin expression which are proposed to increase competition within the meningococcal population for the limited environmental niche of the human nasopharynx. We surmise that competition for the host mucosal surface with the nasopharyngeal microbiome has led to the selection of isolates with traits that enable access to cell types (non-phagocytic and phagocytic) in the submucosal tissues leading to an increased risk for IMD.",34704920

However, overexpression of a gene provides an alternative, powerful tool to elucidate gene function and identify novel phenotypes. Notably, overexpression can identify pathway components that might remain undetected using loss-of-function approaches. Several repressible or inducible promoters have been developed which allow to shut off or turn on the expression of a gene in C. albicans upon growth in the presence of a repressor or inducer.

However, studies focusing on the prevalence and population structure of APEC in the broiler production pyramid are scarce. Here, we used genotyping and serotyping data to elucidate the APEC population structure and its changes in different broiler production stages along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a subset of APEC isolates to determine transmission patterns amongst dominant APEC sequence types (STs) and characterize them in detail. Comparison of genotypes encountered in both APEC and avian fecal <i>E. coli</i> (AFEC) provided further insights. Overall, APEC-related mortality, as the proportion of the total sampled mortality in the broiler production, was high (35%), while phylogroup C and serogroup O78 were predominant amongst APEC isolates. We found a low (34.0%) and high (53.3%) incidence of colibacillosis in chicks and end-cycle broilers, respectively, which may be related to a shift in APEC genotypes, suggesting a trend from commensalism to pathogenicity across different broiler production stages. Despite considerable APEC genotypic diversity, there was substantial genotype overlap (40.9%, overall) over the production stages and convergence of STs to the four clusters. Within these clusters, WGS data provided evidence of clonal transmission events and revealed an enriched virulence and resistance APEC repertoire. More specifically, sequenced APEC were assigned to defined pathotypes based on their virulence gene content while the majority (86%) was genotypically multi-drug resistant. Interestingly, WGS-based phylogeny showed that a subset of APEC, which are cephalosporin-resistant, may originate directly from cephalosporin-resistant AFEC. Finally, exploration of the APEC plasmidome indicated that the small fraction of the APEC virulome carried by IncF plasmids is pivotal for the manifestation of the APEC pathotype; thus, plasmid exchange can promote pathogenicity in strains that are at the edge of the commensal and pathogenic states.",34568479

Application of bio-fertilizer containing beneficial microbes contributes to disease suppression and is a promising strategy to control replanting disease. However, the effect of both replanting disease and bio-fertilizer amendment on the assembly of crop microbiota in leaves and roots and their relationships to crop yield and quality remains elusive. In these experiments, roots and leaves of Radix pseudostellariae were collected from different consecutive monoculture and bio-fertilizer amended fields, and the associated microbiota were characterized by bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Consecutive monoculture altered the bacterial community structure and composition and significantly increased the abundance of potential pathogenic Ralstonia and Fusarium oxysporum in leaves and roots. Furthermore, bio-fertilizer application alleviated replanting disease by decreasing the pathogen load, increasing the potential beneficial genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Paenibacillus, and Bradyrhizobium. The proportion of positive correlations in the co-occurrence network of bio-fertilizer application was the highest, implying that bio-fertilizer potentially enhanced ecological commensalism or mutualism of the bacterial community across the two compartments. Structural equation models indicated that bio-fertilizer had a positive and indirect effect on both yield and quality by shaping the leaf microbiota and the root microbiota. Our findings highlight the role of leaf and root microbiota on replanting disease, showing that bio-fertilizer contributes to alleviating replanting disease by improving microbe-microbe interactions.",34554283

However, molecular investigations of metazoan eukaryomes require minimising coamplification of homologous host genes. In this study we (1) identified a previously published ""antimetazoan"" reverse primer to theoretically enable amplification of a wider range of microeukaryotic symbionts, including more evolutionarily divergent sequence types, (2) evaluated in silico several antimetazoan primer combinations, and (3) optimised the application of the best performing primer pair for high throughput sequencing (HTS) by comparing one-step and two-step PCR amplification approaches, testing different annealing temperatures and evaluating the taxonomic profiles produced by HTS and data analysis. The primer combination 574*F - UNonMet_DB tested in silico showed the largest diversity of nonmetazoan sequence types in the SILVA database and was also the shortest available primer combination for broadly-targeting antimetazoan amplification across the 18S rRNA gene V4 region. We demonstrate that the one-step PCR approach used for library preparation produces significantly lower proportions of metazoan reads, and a more comprehensive coverage of host-associated microeukaryote reads than the two-step approach. Using higher PCR annealing temperatures further increased the proportion of nonmetazoan reads in all sample types tested. The resulting V4 region amplicons were taxonomically informative even when only the forward read is analysed. This region also revealed a diversity of known and putatively parasitic lineages and a wider diversity of host-associated eukaryotes.",34549891

In this study, we aimed at identifying the dominant bacteria in dental plaque to indicate the incidence of caries in the primary dentition. Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on the clinical examination: group CF, children without pigment who had no caries lesions or restorations (n = 18); group CS, children who were diagnosed with severe early childhood caries (n = 17); and group BS, children with pigment (black extrinsic stain) without caries or restorations (n = 15). The total microbial genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq platform. The differential dominant bacteria were determined using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). Co-occurrence network analysis was performed using sparse correlations for compositional data, calculation and functional features were predicted using PICRUSt. Interestingly, our results showed that the relative abundance of Pseudopropionibacterium, Actinomyces, Rothia, and Cardiobacterium was from high to low and that of Porphyromonas was low to high in the BS, CF, and CS groups, consistent with the clinical incidence of caries in the 3 groups. Moreover, an increased level of Selenomonas_3, Fusobacterium, and Leptotrichia was associated with high caries prevalence. We found that the interactions among genera in the BS and CS plaque communities are less complex than those in the CF communities at the taxon level. Functional features, including cofactor and vitamin metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and translation, significantly increased in caries plaque samples.

Less known is how humans influence the post-introduction dynamics of invasive alien populations. The latter requires studying parallel invasions by the same species in habitats that are differently impacted by humans. We analysed microsatellite and genome size variation, and then compared the genetic diversity and structure of invasive Poa annua L. on two sub-Antarctic islands: human-occupied Marion Island and unoccupied Prince Edward Island. We also carried out niche modelling to map the potential distribution of the species on both islands. We found high levels of genetic diversity and evidence for extensive admixture between genetically distinct lineages of P. annua on Marion Island. By contrast, the Prince Edward Island populations showed low genetic diversity, no apparent admixture, and had smaller genomes. On both islands, high genetic diversity was apparent at human landing sites, and on Marion Island, also around human settlements, suggesting that these areas received multiple introductions and/or acted as initial introduction sites and secondary sources (bridgeheads) for invasive populations. More than 70years of continuous human activity associated with a meteorological station on Marion Island led to a distribution of this species around human settlements and along footpaths, which facilitates ongoing gene flow among geographically separated populations. By contrast, this was not the case for Prince Edward Island, where P. annua populations showed high genetic structure. The high levels of genetic variation and admixture in P. annua facilitated by human activity, coupled with high habitat suitability on both islands, suggest that P. annua is likely to increase its distribution and abundance in the future.",34181792

Yet, S. aureus is also carried asymptomatically in the sinonasal cavity of 50% of healthy adults. The causes of this duality and host and microbial factors that tip the balance between S. aureus pathogenesis and commensalism are poorly understood. We have shown that by degrading mucins, anaerobic microbiota support the growth of airway pathogens by liberating metabolites that are otherwise unavailable. Given the widely reported culture-based detection of anaerobes from individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), here we tested our hypothesis that CRS microbiota is characterized by a mucin-degrading phenotype that alters S. aureus physiology. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we indeed observed an increased prevalence and abundance of anaerobes in CRS relative to non-CRS controls. PICRUSt2-based functional predictions suggested increased mucin degradation potential among CRS microbiota that was confirmed by direct enrichment culture. <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Fusobacterium</i>, and Streptococcus comprised a core mucin-degrading community across CRS subjects that generated a nutrient pool that augmented S. aureus growth on mucin as a carbon source. Finally, using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), we observed that S. aureus transcription is profoundly altered in the presence of mucin-derived metabolites, though expression of several key metabolism- and virulence-associated pathways varied between CRS-derived bacterial communities. Together, these data support a model in which S. aureus metabolism and virulence in the upper airways are dependent upon the composition of cocolonizing microbiota and the metabolites they exchange.",34125598
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Hyperexpression of CDRs and HWP1 genes negatively impacts on Candida albicans virulence.,"C. albicans is a commensal organism present in the human microbiome of more than 60% of the healthy population. Transition from commensalism to invasive candidiasis may occur after a local or a general failure of host's immune system. This transition to a more virulent phenotype may reside either on the capacity to form hyphae or on an acquired resistance to antifungal drugs. Indeed, overexpression of genes coding drug efflux pumps or adhesins, cell wall proteins facilitating the contact between the fungus and the host, usually marks the virulence profile of invasive Candida spp. In this paper, we compare virulence of two clinical isolates of C. albicans with that of laboratory-induced resistant strains by challenging G. mellonella larvae with these pathogens along with monitoring transcriptional profiles of drug efflux pumps genes CDR1, CDR2, MDR1 and the adhesin genes ALS1 and HWP1. Although both clinical isolates were found resistant to both fluconazole and micafungin they were found less virulent than laboratory-induced resistant strains. An unexpected behavior emerged for the former clinical isolate in which three genes, CDR1, CDR2 and HWP1, usually correlated with virulence, although hyperexpressed, conferred a less aggressive phenotype. On the contrary, in the other isolate, we observed a decreased expression of CDR1, CDR2 and HWP1as well as of MDR1 and ALS1 that may be consistent with the less aggressive performance observed in this strain. These altered gene expressions might directly influence Candida virulence or they might be an epiphenomenon of a vaster rearrangement occurred in these strains during the challenge with the host's environment. An in-deepth comprehension of this scenario could be crucial for developing interventions able to counteract C. albicans invasiveness and lethality.",34061886

Here we employ a novel approach to preferentially deplete host 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons to reveal the composition of the eukaryotic microbial communities of <i>Anopheles</i> larvae sampled in Kenya, Burkina Faso and Republic of Guinea (Conakry). We identified 453 eukaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with <i>Anopheles</i> larvae in nature, but an average of 45% of the 18S rRNA sequences clustered into OTUs that lacked a taxonomic assignment in the Silva database. Thus, the <i>Anopheles</i> microbiome contains a striking proportion of novel eukaryotic taxa. Using sequence similarity matching and <i>de novo</i> phylogenetic placement, the fraction of unassigned sequences was reduced to an average of 4%, and many unclassified OTUs were assigned as relatives of known taxa. A novel taxon of the genus <i>Ophryocystis</i> in the phylum Apicomplexa (which also includes <i>Plasmodium</i>) is widespread in <i>Anopheles</i> larvae from East and West Africa. Notably, <i>Ophryocystis</i> is present at fluctuating abundance among larval breeding sites, consistent with the expected pattern of an epidemic pathogen. Species richness of the eukaryotic microbiome was not significantly different across sites from East to West Africa, while species richness of the prokaryotic microbiome was significantly lower in West Africa. Laboratory colonies of <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> harbor 26 eukaryotic OTUs, of which 38% (<i>n</i> = 10) are shared with wild populations, while 16 OTUs are unique to the laboratory colonies. Genetically distinct <i>An. coluzzii</i> colonies co-housed in the same facility maintain different prokaryotic microbiome profiles, suggesting a persistent host genetic influence on microbiome composition.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Bacterial Carriage of Genes Encoding Fibronectin-Binding Proteins Is Associated with Long-Term Persistence of Staphylococcus aureus in the Nasal and Gut Microbiota of Infants.,"Staphylococcus aureus can colonize both the anterior nares and the gastrointestinal tract. However, colonization at these sites in the same individuals has not been studied, and the traits that facilitate colonization and persistence at these sites have not been compared. Samples from the nostrils and feces collected on 9 occasions from 3days to 3years of age in 65 infants were cultured; 54 samples yielded S. aureus. The numbers of nasal and fecal S. aureus strains increased rapidly during the first weeks and were similar at 1month of age (>40% of infants colonized). Thereafter, nasal carriage declined, while fecal carriage remained high during the first year of life. Individual strains were identified, and their colonization patterns were related to their carriage of genes encoding adhesins and superantigenic toxins. Strains retrieved from both the nose and gut (<i>n</i>=44) of an infant were 4.5 times more likely to colonize long term (3weeks at both sites) than strains found only in the rectum/feces (<i>n</i>=56) or only in the nose (<i>n</i>=32) (<i>P</i>0.001). Gut colonization was significantly associated with carriage of the <i>fnbA</i> gene, and long-term colonization at either site was associated with carriage of <i>fnbA</i> and <i>fnbB.</i> In summary, gut colonization by S. aureus was more common than nasal carriage by S. aureus in the studied infants. Gut strains may provide a reservoir for invasive disease in vulnerable individuals. Fibronectin-binding adhesins and other virulence factors may facilitate commensal colonization and confer pathogenic potential. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> S. aureus may cause severe infections and frequently colonizes the nose. Nasal carriage of S. aureus increases 3-fold the risk of invasive S. aureus infection. S. aureus is also commonly found in the gut microbiota of infants and young children. However, the relationships between the adhesins and other virulence factors of S. aureus strains and its abilities to colonize the nostrils and gut of infants are not well understood. Our study explores the simultaneous colonization by S. aureus of the nasal and intestinal tracts of newborn infants through 3years of follow-up. We identify bacterial virulence traits that appear to facilitate persistent colonization of the nose and gut by S. aureus. This expands our current knowledge of the interplay between bacterial commensalism and pathogenicity. Moreover, it may contribute to the development of targeted strategies for combating S. aureus infection.",34020939

Specific species of resident bacteria, as known as pathobiont, have pathogenic potential and can induce apparent damage to the host and intestinal inflammation in a certain condition. However, the host immune factors that permit its commensalism under steady state conditions are not clearly understood. Here, we studied the gut fitness of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> by using germ-free (GF) mice orally infected with this food-borne pathogen. <i>L. monocytogenes</i> persistently exists in the gut of GF mice without inducing chronic immunopathology. <i>L. monocytogenes</i> at the late phase of infection is not capable of infiltrating through the intestinal barrier. <i>L. monocytogenes</i> established the commensalism through the reversible down regulation of virulence gene expression.

C.albicans transcription factors (TFs), Wor1 and Efg1, are master regulators of an epigenetic switch required for fungal mating that also control colonization of the mammalian gut. We show that additional mating regulators, WOR2, WOR3, WOR4, AHR1, CZF1, and SSN6, also influence gut commensalism. Using Calling Card-seq to record Candida TF DNA-binding events in the host, we examine the role and relationships of these regulators during murine gut colonization. By comparing in-host transcriptomes of regulatory mutants with enhanced versus diminished commensal fitness, we also identify a set of candidate commensalism effectors. These include Cht2, a GPI-linked chitinase whose gene is bound by Wor1, Czf1, and Efg1 invivo, that we show promotes commensalism. Thus, the network required for a C.albicans sexual switch is biochemically active in the host intestine and repurposed to direct commensalism.",33915113

Yet, C. albicans can under certain circumstances undergo a shift from commensalism to pathogenicity. This transition is governed by fungal factors such as morphological transitions, environmental cues for instance relationships with gut microbiota and the host immune system. C. albicans utilizes distinct sets of regulatory programs to colonize or infect its host and to evade the host defense systems. Moreover, an orchestrated iron acquisition mechanism operates to adapt to specific niches with variable iron availability. Studies on regulatory networks and morphogenesis of these two distinct modes of C. albicans growth, suggest that both yeast and hyphal forms exist in both growth patterns and the regulatory circuits are inter-connected.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Escherichia coli Genomic Diversity within Extraintestinal Acute Infections Argues for Adaptive Evolution at Play.,"Adaptive processes in chronic bacterial infections are well described, but much less is known about the processes at play during acute infections. Here, by sequencing seven randomly selected isolates per patient, we analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> populations from three acute extraintestinal infections in adults (meningitis, pyelonephritis, and peritonitis), in which a high-mutation-rate isolate or mutator isolate was found. The isolates of single patients displayed between a few dozen and more than 200 independent mutations, with up to half being specific to the mutator isolate. Multiple signs of positive selection were evidenced: a high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> /<i>K<sub>s</sub></i> ratio) and strong mutational convergence within and between patients, some of them at loci well known for their adaptive potential, such as <i>rpoS</i>, <i>rbsR</i>, <i>fimH</i>, and <i>fliC</i> For all patients, the mutator isolate was likely due to a large deletion of a methyl-directed mismatch repair gene, and in two instances, the deletion extended to genes involved in some genetic convergence, suggesting potential coselection. Intrinsic extraintestinal virulence assessed in a mouse model of sepsis showed variable patterns of virulence ranging from non-mouse killer to mouse killer for the isolates from single patients. However, genomic signature and gene inactivation experiments did not establish a link between a single gene and the capacity to kill mice, highlighting the complex and multifactorial nature of the virulence. Altogether, these data indicate that <i>E. coli</i> isolates are adapting under strong selective pressure when colonizing an extraintestinal site.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Little is known about the dynamics of adaptation in acute bacterial infections. By sequencing multiple isolates from monoclonal extraintestinal <i>Escherichia coli</i> infections in several patients, we were able to uncover traces of selection taking place at short time scales compared to chronic infection. High genomic diversity was observed in the patient isolates, with an excess of nonsynonymous mutations, and the comparison within and between different infections showed patterns of convergence at the gene level, both constituting strong signs of adaptation. The genes targeted were coding mostly for proteins involved in global regulation, metabolism, and adhesion/motility. Moreover, virulence assessed in a mouse model of sepsis was variable among the isolates of single patients, but this difference was left unexplained at the molecular level. This work gives us clues about the <i>E. coli</i> lifestyle transition between commensalism and pathogenicity.",33408235
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Wor1-regulated ferroxidases contribute to pigment formation in opaque cells of Candidaalbicans.,"Candidaalbicans is a harmless commensal resident in the human gut and a prevalent opportunistic pathogen. A key part of its commensalism and pathogenesis is its ability to switch between different morphological forms, including white-to-opaque switching. The Wor1 protein was previously identified as a master regulator of white-to-opaque switching in mating type locus (MTL) homozygous cells. The mechanisms by which the dark color of the opaque colonies is controlled and the pimpled surface of opaque cells is formed remain unknown. Candidaalbicans produces melanin pigment invitro and during infection. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of melanin production is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that ferroxidases (Fets) function as pigment multicopper oxidases and regulate the production of dark-pigmented melanin in opaque cells. The FET genes presented distinct regulation patterns in response to different extracellular stimuli. In YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% dextrose)-rich medium, four of the five FET genes were up-regulated by Wor1, especially at the human body temperature of 37C. In minimal medium with low ammonium concentrations, all five FET genes were up-regulated by Wor1. However, at high ammonium concentrations, some FET genes were down-regulated by Wor1. Wor1-up-regulated Fets contributed to dark pigment formation in opaque colonies, but not to the elongated shape of these opaque cells. Increased melanin externalization was associated with the pimpled surface of the opaque cells. Melanized C.albicans cells were more resistant to fungal clearance. Deletion of the five FET genes completely blocked melanin production in opaque cells and resulted in the generation of white elongated 'opaque' cells. In addition, the up-regulated Fets are important for defense against oxidant attacks. The functional diversity of Fets may reflect the multiple strategies of C.albicans to rapidly adapt to diverse host niches.",33350590
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Beyond the pan-genome: current perspectives on the functional and practical outcomes of the distributed genome hypothesis.,"The principle of monoclonality with regard to bacterial infections was considered immutable prior to 30 years ago. This view, espoused by Koch for acute infections, has proven inadequate regarding chronic infections as persistence requires multiple forms of heterogeneity among the bacterial population. This understanding of bacterial plurality emerged from a synthesis of what-were-then novel technologies in molecular biology and imaging science. These technologies demonstrated that bacteria have complex life cycles, polymicrobial ecologies, and evolve in situ via the horizontal exchange of genic characters. Thus, there is an ongoing generation of diversity during infection that results in far more highly complex microbial communities than previously envisioned. This perspective is based on the fundamental tenet that the bacteria within an infecting population display genotypic diversity, including gene possession differences, which result from horizontal gene transfer mechanisms including transformation, conjugation, and transduction. This understanding is embodied in the concepts of the supragenome/pan-genome and the distributed genome hypothesis (DGH). These paradigms have fostered multiple researches in diverse areas of bacterial ecology including host-bacterial interactions covering the gamut of symbiotic relationships including mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. With regard to the human host, within each of these symbiotic relationships all bacterial species possess attributes that contribute to colonization and persistence; those species/strains that are pathogenic also encode traits for invasion and metastases.

Understanding the precise cross talk between virus and host is vital for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the present study, we identified the nucleoprotein (NP) of H7N9 IAV as a positive regulator of RIG-I like receptor (RLR)-mediated signaling. Based on a loss-of-function strategy, we replaced H1N1 (mouse-adapted PR8 strain) NP with H7N9 NP, by using reverse genetics, and found that the replication and pathogenicity of recombinant PR8-H7N9NP (rPR8-H7N9NP) were significantly attenuated in cells and mice. Biochemical and cellular analyses revealed that H7N9 NP specifically interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) after viral infection. Subsequently, we identified a PXXQXS motif in the H7N9 NP that may be a determinant for the NP and TRAF3 interaction. Furthermore, H7N9 NP stabilized TRAF3 expression via competitively binding to TRAF3 with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2), leading to the inhibition of the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3. Taken together, these data uncover a novel mechanism by which the NP of H7N9 IAV positively regulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon signaling. Our findings provide insights into virus and host survival strategies that involve a specific viral protein that modulates an appropriate immune response in hosts.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The NS1, PB2, PA-X, and PB1-F2 proteins of influenza A virus (IAV) are known to employ various strategies to counteract and evade host defenses. However, the viral components responsible for the activation of innate immune signaling remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the NP of H7N9 IAV specifically associates with and stabilizes the important adaptor molecule TRAF3, which potentiates RLR-mediated type I interferon induction. Moreover, we reveal that this H7N9 NP protein prevents the interaction between TRAF3 and cIAP2 that mediates Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 for degradation. The current study revealed a novel mechanism by which H7N9 NP upregulates TRAF3-mediated type I interferon production, leading to attenuation of viral replication and pathogenicity in cells and mice.

Inhaled allergens encounter the host immune system first in the nasal mucosa, and microbial characteristics of nasal mucus directly impact the mechanisms of initial allergic responses in nasal epithelium. However, the roles of the nasal microbiome in allergic nasal mucosa remain uncertain. We sought to determine the distribution of nasal microbiomes in allergic nasal mucosa and elucidate the interplay between nasal microbiome Staphylococcus species and Th2 cytokines in allergic rhinitis (AR) models. Staphylococcus aureus (AR-SA) and S. epidermidis (AR-SE) were isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients with AR. The influence of nasal microbiome Staphylococcus species on allergic nasal mucosa was also tested with in vitro and in vivo AR models. Pyrosequencing data showed that colonization by S. epidermidis and S. aureus was more dominant in nasal mucus of AR subjects. The mRNA and protein levels of IL-33 and TSLP were significantly higher in AR nasal epithelial (ARNE) cells which were cultured from nasal mucosa of AR subjects, and exposure of ARNE cells to AR-SA reduced IL-33 mRNA and secreted protein levels. Particularly, ovalbumin-driven AR mice inoculated with AR-SA by intranasal delivery exhibited significantly reduced IL-33 in their nasal mucosa. In the context of these results, allergic symptoms and Th2 cytokine levels were significantly downregulated after intranasal inoculation of AR-SA in vivo AR mice. Colonization by Staphylococcus species was more dominant in allergic nasal mucosa, and nasal commensal S. aureus from subjects with AR mediates anti-allergic effects by modulating IL-33-dependent Th2 inflammation.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported to consist of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and differentiated cancer cells (non-CSCs). In the present study, organoid models were employed to show that CSCs and non-CSCs in CRC were characterized by distinct metabolic phenotypes. Treatment with either non-CSC-derived conditioned medium or exogenous lactate enhanced organoid-forming and tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. In tumor regeneration assays with co-implanted CSCs and non-CSCs, the tumor-initiating activity was reduced when either monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4 in non-CSCs or MCT1 in CSCs was silenced or inhibited. Mechanistically, oxiadative phosphorylation-derived reactive oxygen species in CSCs activated AKT-Wnt/-catenin signaling, which could be induced by lactate from non-CSCs. Overall, these results suggest that CSCs and non-CSCs possess distinct metabolic profiles and, unexpectedly, non-CSC-originated lactate promotes self-renewal of CSCs and thus contributes to CRC progression.

Murine macrophages were coinfected with <i>S. gordonii</i> or <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, along with <i>C. albicans</i> to evaluate changes in fungal survival. <i>S. gordonii</i> increased <i>C. albicans</i> survival and filamentation within macrophage phagosomes, while <i>P. aeruginosa</i> reduced fungal survival and filamentation. Coinfection with <i>S. gordonii</i> resulted in greater escape of <i>C. albicans</i> from macrophages and increased size of fungal microcolonies formed on macrophage monolayers, while coinfection with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> reduced macrophage escape and produced smaller microcolonies.

Signaling pathways coordinate stress adaptation and are essential for commensalism and virulence. The transcription factors Sko1, Cas5, and Rlm1 control the response to cell wall stress caused by the antifungal drug caspofungin. Here, we expand the Sko1 and Rlm1 transcriptional circuit and demonstrate that Rlm1 activates Sko1 cell wall stress signaling. Caspofungin-induced transcription of SKO1 and several Sko1-dependent cell wall integrity genes are attenuated in an rlm1/ mutant strain when compared to the treated wild-type strain but not in a cas5/ mutant strain. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) results revealed numerous Sko1 and Rlm1 directly bound target genes in the presence of caspofungin that were undetected in previous gene expression studies. Notable targets include genes involved in cell wall integrity, osmolarity, and cellular aggregation, as well as several uncharacterized genes. Interestingly, we found that Rlm1 does not bind to the upstream intergenic region of SKO1 in the presence of caspofungin, indicating that Rlm1 indirectly controls caspofungin-induced SKO1 transcription. In addition, we discovered that caspofungin-induced SKO1 transcription occurs through self-activation. Based on our ChIP-seq data, we also discovered an Rlm1 consensus motif unique to C. albicans. For Sko1, we found a consensus motif similar to the known Sko1 motif for Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In this study, we identified the <i>C. jejuni</i> butyrate-modulated regulon and discovered that the BumSR two-component signal transduction system (TCS) directs a response to butyrate by identifying mutants in a genetic screen defective for butyrate-modulated transcription. The BumSR TCS, which is important for infection of humans and optimal colonization of avian hosts, senses butyrate likely by indirect means to alter transcription of genes encoding important colonization determinants. Unlike many canonical TCSs, the predicted cytoplasmic sensor kinase BumS lacked in vitro autokinase activity, which would normally lead to phosphorylation of the cognate BumR response regulator. Instead, BumS has likely evolved mutations to naturally function as a phosphatase whose activity is influenced by exogenous butyrate to control the level of endogenous phosphorylation of BumR and its ability to alter transcription of target genes. To our knowledge, the BumSR TCS is the only bacterial signal transduction system identified so far that mediates responses to the microbiota-generated intestinal metabolite butyrate, an important factor for host intestinal health and homeostasis.

This suppleness requires an effective mechanism to reversibly reprogram the primary metabolism in response to oxygen variation. Here, we have uncovered that Snf5, a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is a major transcriptional regulator that links oxygen status to the metabolic capacity of C. albicans. Snf5 and other subunits of SWI/SNF complex were required to activate genes of carbon utilization and other carbohydrates related process specifically under hypoxia. snf5 mutant exhibited an altered metabolome reflecting that SWI/SNF plays an essential role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and carbon flux in C. albicans under hypoxia. Snf5 was necessary to activate the transcriptional program linked to both commensal and invasive growth. Accordingly, snf5 was unable to maintain its growth in the stomach, the cecum and the colon of mice. snf5 was also avirulent as it was unable to invade Galleria larvae or to cause damage to human enterocytes and murine macrophages. Among candidates of signaling pathways in which Snf5 might operate, phenotypic analysis revealed that mutants of Ras1-cAMP-PKA pathway, as well as mutants of Yak1 and Yck2 kinases exhibited a similar carbon flexibility phenotype as did snf5 under hypoxia.

Thus, the major adhesin Als1p interacts through amyloid-like -aggregation to cluster adhesin molecules in <i>cis</i> on the cell surface as well as in <i>trans</i> to form cell-cell bonds.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbial cell surface adhesins control essential processes such as adhesion, colonization, and biofilm formation. In the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i>, the <u>a</u>gglutinin-<u>l</u>ike <u>s</u>equence (<i>ALS</i>) gene family encodes eight cell surface glycoproteins that mediate adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces and cell-cell aggregation. Als proteins are critical for commensalism and virulence. Their activities include attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells, morphogenesis, and formation of biofilms on host tissue and indwelling medical catheters. At the molecular level, Als5p-mediated cell-cell aggregation is dependent on the formation of amyloid-like nanodomains between Als5p-expressing cells. A single-site mutation to valine 326 abolishes cellular aggregation and amyloid formation. Our results show that the binding characteristics of Als1p follow a mechanistic model similar to Als5p, despite its differential expression and biological roles.",31594814
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Keeping <i>Candida</i> commensal: how lactobacilli antagonize pathogenicity of <i>Candida albicans</i> in an <i>in vitro</i> gut model.,"The intestine is the primary reservoir of <i>Candida albicans</i> that can cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients. In this reservoir, the fungus exists as a harmless commensal. However, antibiotic treatment can disturb the bacterial microbiota, facilitating fungal overgrowth and favoring pathogenicity. The current <i>in vitro</i> gut models that are used to study the pathogenesis of <i>C. albicans</i> investigate the state in which <i>C. albicans</i> behaves as a pathogen rather than as a commensal. We present a novel <i>in vitro</i> gut model in which the fungal pathogenicity is reduced to a minimum by increasing the biological complexity. In this model, enterocytes represent the epithelial barrier and goblet cells limit <i>C. albicans</i> adhesion and invasion. Significant protection against <i>C. albicans-</i>induced necrotic damage was achieved by the introduction of a microbiota of antagonistic lactobacilli. We demonstrated a time-, dose- and species-dependent protective effect against <i>C. albicans</i>-induced cytotoxicity. This required bacterial growth, which relied on the presence of host cells, but was not dependent on the competition for adhesion sites. <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> reduced hyphal elongation, a key virulence attribute. Furthermore, bacterial-driven shedding of hyphae from the epithelial surface, associated with apoptotic epithelial cells, was identified as a main and novel mechanism of damage protection. However, host cell apoptosis was not the driving mechanism behind shedding. Collectively, we established an <i>in vitro</i> gut model that can be used to experimentally dissect commensal-like interactions of <i>C. albicans</i> with a bacterial microbiota and the host epithelial barrier. We also discovered fungal shedding as a novel mechanism by which bacteria contribute to the protection of epithelial surfaces.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.",31413153

Probiotics can modulate gut microbiota and the gut environment by releasing a range of bioactive compounds. <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) strain Nissle 1917 (EcN), a Gram-negative bacterial strain, has been used to treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (<i>i.e.</i>, inflammatory bowel disease, diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, and so on). However, endotoxicity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut, is known to have a strong influence on gut inflammation and maintenance of gut homeostasis. Therefore, characterizing the chemical structure of lipid A which determines the toxicity of LPS is needed to understand nonpathogenic colonization and commensalism properties of EcN in the gut more precisely. In the present study, MALDI multiple-stage mass spectrometry analysis of lipid A extracted from EcN demonstrates that hexaacylated lipid A (<i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 1919.19) contains a glucosamine disaccharide backbone, a myristate, a laurate, four 3-hydroxylmyristates, two phosphates, and phosphoethanolamine (PEA). PEA modification of lipid A is known to contribute to cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. To confirm the role of PEA in CAMP resistance of EcN, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of polymyxin B and colistin were determined using a wild-type strain and a mutant strain with deletion of <i>eptA</i> gene encoding PEA transferase. Our results confirmed that MICs of polymyxin B and colistin for the wild-type were twice as high as those for the mutant. These results indicate that EcN can more efficiently colonize the intestine through PEA-mediated tolerance despite the presence of CAMPs in human gut such as human defensins. Thus, EcN can be used to help treat and prevent many GI disorders.",35519361

The evolution of compounds used in scent marks has the potential to inform our understanding of signal evolution in relation to social and sexual selection. A major challenge in studies of chemical communication is that the link between semiochemical compounds and genetic changes is often unclear. The major urinary proteins (MUPs) of house mice provide information on sex, status and individual identity. Importantly, MUPs are a direct protein product of genes, providing a clear link between genotype and phenotype. Here, we examine the evolution of urinary protein signals among house mice and relatives by examining the sequences and patterns of mRNA expression of Mup genes related to urinary scent marks. MUP patterns have evolved among mouse species both by gene duplication and variation in expression. Notably, protein scent signals that are male specific in well-studied inbred laboratory strains vary in sex-specificity among species. Our data reveal that individual identity signals in MUPs evolved prior to 0.35million years ago and have rapidly diversified through recombining a modest number of amino acid variants. Amino acid variants are much more common on the exterior of the protein where they could interact with vomeronasal receptors, suggesting that chemosensory perception may have played a major role in shaping MUP diversity. These data highlight diverse processes and pressures shaping scent signals, and suggest new avenues for using wild mice to probe the evolution of signals and signal processing.",31232499

Next-generation sequencing has revealed co-infection of C18 by a positive-strand RNA virus, hypovirus 4 (CHV4). The current molecular and genetic analyses showed interesting commensal interactions between the two viruses. CHV4 facilitated the stable infection and enhanced vertical transmission of MyRV2, which was readily lost during subculturing and showed reduced vertical transmission in single infections. Deletion of a key antiviral RNA silencing gene, dcl2, in isolate C18 increased stability of MyRV2 in single infections. The ability of CHV4 to facilitate stable infection with MyRV2 appears to be associated with the inhibitory effect of CHV4 on RNA silencing via compromising the induction of transcriptional up-regulation of dcl2. These results suggest that natural infection of isolate C18 by MyRV2 in the field was facilitated by CHV4 co-infection.",31146252

The majority of isolates from hosts are heterozygous at the mating type locus (<i>MTL</i><b>a</b>/), and a third of these have recently been shown to be capable of switching to the opaque phenotype. Here we have investigated the roles of two transcription factors (TFs) Sfl2 and Efg1, in repressing switching in <b>a</b>/ strains.

These conditions are similar to those in the host. Our results further reveal that while glucose is a repressor of <i>sfl2</i> and <i>efg1</i> switching, GlcNAc is an inducer. Finally, we show that when GlcNAc is the carbon source, and the temperature is low (25C), the <i>efg1</i> mutants, but not the <i>sfl2</i> mutants, form a tiny, elongate cell, which differentiates into an opaque cell when transferred to conditions optimal for <b>a</b>/ switching.

Our understanding of the host mechanisms that regulate bacterial commensalism has increased substantially, however, much less data exist regarding host responses to members of the fungal microbiota on colonized surfaces. Using a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis, we have recently shown that differences in immune activation in response to diverse natural isolates of <i>Candida albicans</i> are associated with different outcomes of the host-fungal interaction. Here we applied a genome-wide transcriptomic approach to show that rapid induction of a strong inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil-associated genes upon <i>C. albicans</i> colonization inversely correlated with the ability of the fungus to persist in the oral mucosa. Surprisingly, persistent fungal isolates showed no signs of a compensatory regulatory immune response. By combining RNA-seq data, genetic mouse models, and co-infection experiments, we show that attenuation of the inflammatory response at the onset of infection with a persistent isolate is not a consequence of enhanced immunosuppression. Importantly, depletion of regulatory T cells or deletion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 did not alter host-protective type 17 immunity nor did it impair fungal survival in the oral mucosa, indicating that persistence of <i>C. albicans</i> in the oral mucosa is not a consequence of suppressed antifungal immunity.",30873177

However, competitive infections of C.albicans homozygous gene disruption mutants revealed an unanticipated, inhibitory role for the yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis program on commensalism. We show that the transcription factor Ume6, a master regulator of filamentation, inhibits gut colonization, not by effects on cell shape, but by activating the expression of a hypha-specific pro-inflammatory secreted protease, Sap6, and a hyphal cell surface adhesin, Hyr1. Like a ume6 mutant, strains lacking SAP6 exhibit enhanced colonization fitness, whereas SAP6-overexpression strains are attenuated in the gut.

Recent efforts to catalogue genomic variation among major human fungal pathogens have unveiled evolutionary themes that shape the fungal genome. Mechanisms ranging from large scale changes such as aneuploidy and ploidy cycling as well as more targeted mutations like base substitutions and gene copy number variations contribute to the evolution of these species, which are often under multiple competing selective pressures with their host, environment, and other microbes.

Bioremediation is generally inhibited by co-contaminate CVOCs; with only a few specific bacterial taxa reported to metabolize or cometabolize 1,4-dioxane being unaffected. Chemical oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as a non-selective treatment demonstrated 50-80% 1,4-dioxane removal regardless of the initial CVOC concentrations. Post-oxidation bioaugmentation with 1,4-dioxane metabolizer Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 removed the remaining 1,4-dioxane. The intrinsic microbial population, biodiversity, richness, and biomarker gene abundances decreased immediately after the brief oxidation phase, but recovery of cultivable microbiomes and a more diverse community were observed during the subsequent 9-week biodegradation phase. Results generated from the Illumina Miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analyses established that generally oxidative stress tolerant genus Ralstonia was abundant after the oxidation step, and Cupriavidus, Pseudolabrys, Afipia, and Sphingomonas were identified as dominant genera after aerobic incubation. Multidimensional analysis elucidated the separation of microbial populations as a function of time under all conditions, suggesting that temporal succession is a determining factor that is independent of 1,4-dioxane and CVOCs mixtures. Network analysis highlighted the potential interspecies competition or commensalism, and dynamics of microbiomes during the biodegradation phase, in line with the shifts of predominant genera and various developing directions during different steps of the treatment train. Collectively, this study demonstrated that chemical oxidation followed by bioaugmentation is effective for treating 1,4-dioxane, even in the presence of high levels of CVOC mixtures and residual peroxide, a disinfectant, and enhanced our understanding of microbial ecological impacts of the treatment train.

Yet, despite their ubiquity and familiarity to humans, surprisingly little is known about their origins. We sought to investigate the evolutionary history of the house sparrow and identify the processes involved in its transition to a human-commensal niche. We used a whole genome resequencing dataset of 120 individuals from three Eurasian species, including three populations of Bactrianus sparrows, a non-commensal, divergent house sparrow lineage occurring in the Near East. Coalescent modelling supports a split between house and Bactrianus sparrow 11 Kya and an expansion in the house sparrow at 6 Kya, consistent with the spread of agriculture following the Neolithic revolution. Commensal house sparrows therefore likely moved into Europe with the spread of agriculture following this period. Using the Bactrianus sparrow as a proxy for a pre-commensal, ancestral house population, we performed a comparative genome scan to identify genes potentially involved with adaptation to an anthropogenic niche. We identified potential signatures of recent, positive selection in the genome of the commensal house sparrow that are absent in Bactrianus populations. The strongest selected region encompasses two major candidate genes; <i>COL11A</i>-which regulates craniofacial and skull development and <i>AMY2A</i>, part of the amylase gene family which has previously been linked to adaptation to high-starch diets in humans and dogs.

We have shown in previous work that homologous recombination between adenoviral genomes of human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), the largest and fastest growing HAdV species, is responsible for the rapid evolution of this species. Because adenovirus infection initiates in mucosal epithelia, particularly at the gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and ocular surfaces, we sought to determine a possible role for mucosal microbiota in adenovirus genome diversity. By analysis of known recombination hot spots across 38 human adenovirus genomes in species D (HAdV-D), we identified nucleotide sequence motifs similar to bacterial Chi sequences, which facilitate homologous recombination in the presence of bacterial Rec enzymes. These motifs, referred to here as Chi<sub>AD</sub>, were identified immediately 5' to the sequence encoding penton base hypervariable loop 2, which expresses the arginine-glycine-aspartate moiety critical to adenoviral cellular entry. Coinfection with two HAdV-Ds in the presence of an <i>Escherichiacoli</i> lysate increased recombination; this was blocked in a RecA mutant strain, <i>E.coli</i> DH5, or upon RecA depletion. Recombination increased in the presence of <i>E.coli</i> lysate despite a general reduction in viral replication. RecA colocalized with viral DNA in HAdV-D-infected cell nuclei and was shown to bind specifically to Chi<sub>AD</sub> sequences.

Here, we report finding Chi-like sequences in adenovirus recombination hot spots. Adenovirus coinfection in the presence of bacterial RecA protein facilitated homologous recombination between viruses. Genetic recombination led to evolution of an important external feature on the adenoviral capsid, namely, the penton base protein hypervariable loop 2, which contains the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif critical to viral internalization.

Despite this global impact on health and human capital, how zoonotic C. jejuni responds to the human host remains unclear. Unlike other intestinal pathogens, C. jejuni does not harbour pathogen-defining toxins that explicitly contribute to disease in humans. This makes understanding Campylobacter pathogenesis challenging and supports a broad examination of bacterial factors that contribute to C. jejuni infection. Here, we use a controlled human infection model to characterize C. jejuni transcriptional and genetic adaptations in vivo, along with a non-human primate infection model to validate our approach. We found that variation in 11 genes is associated with either acute or persistent human infections and includes products involved in host cell invasion, bile sensing and flagella modification, plus additional potential therapeutic targets. In particular, a functional version of the cell invasion protein A (cipA) gene product is strongly associated with persistently infecting bacteria and we identified its biochemical role in flagella modification. These data characterize the adaptive C. jejuni response to primate infections and suggest therapy design should consider the intrinsic differences between acute and persistently infecting bacteria. In addition, RNA sequencing revealed conserved responses during natural host commensalism and human infections. Thirty-nine genes were differentially regulated in vivo across hosts, lifestyles and C. jejuni strains. This conserved in vivo response highlights important C. jejuni survival mechanisms such as iron acquisition and evasion of the host mucosal immune response.

In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and microarray analysis to investigate the genomic determinants of the phenotypic changes observed in two <i>C. albicans</i> clinical isolates (YL1 and YQ2). <i>In vitro</i> experiments employing epithelial, microglial, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thus used to evaluate <i>C. albicans</i> isolates interaction with first line host defenses, measuring adhesion, susceptibility to phagocytosis, and induction of secretory responses. Moreover, a murine model of peritoneal infection was used to compare the <i>in vivo</i> pathogenic potential of the two isolates. Genome sequence and gene expression analysis of <i>C. albicans</i> YL1 and YQ2 showed significant changes in cellular pathways involved in environmental stress response, adhesion, filamentous growth, invasiveness, and dimorphic transition. This was in accordance with the observed marked phenotypic differences in biofilm production, dimorphic switch efficiency, cell adhesion, invasion, and survival to phagocyte-mediated host defenses. The mutations in key regulators of the hyphal growth pathway in the more virulent strain corresponded to an overall greater number of budding yeast cells released. Compared to YQ2, YL1 consistently showed enhanced pathogenic potential, since <i>in vitro</i>, it was less susceptible to ingestion by phagocytic cells and more efficient in invading epithelial cells, while <i>in vivo</i> YL1 was more effective than YQ2 in recruiting inflammatory cells, eliciting IL-1 response and eluding phagocytic cells. Overall, these results indicate an unexpected isolate-specific variation in pathways important for host invasion and colonization, showing how the genetic background of <i>C. albicans</i> may greatly affect its behavior both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Based on this approach, we propose that the co-occurrence of changes in sequence and expression in genes and pathways driving dimorphic transition and pathogenicity reflects a selective balance between traits favoring dissemination of the pathogen and traits involved in host defense evasion.

HL-58, to ask two fundamental scientific questions: 1) how do the phenotypes of two naturally co-existing species respond to partnership as compared to axenic growth? and 2) how do growth and molecular phenotypes of these species change with respect to competitive and commensal interactions? We hypothesized - and confirmed - that co-cultivation under glucose as the sole carbon source would result in competitive interactions. Similarly, when glucose was swapped with xylose, the interactions became commensal because Marinobacter HL-58 was supported by metabolites derived from Halomonas HL-48. Each species responded to partnership by changing both its growth and molecular phenotype as assayed via batch growth kinetics and global transcriptomics.

Surprisingly, no studies have been carried out on the identification of genetic and molecular bases underlying natural variation in positive interactions. The candidate genes underlying natural plant-plant interactions can be classified into seven categories of plant function that have been identified in artificial environments simulating plant-plant interactions either frequently (photosynthesis, hormones), only recently (cell wall modification and degradation, defense pathways against pathogens) or rarely (ABC transporters, histone modification and meristem identity/life history traits).

It is crucial to elucidate how human activities alter gene flow and what are the consequences for the genetic structure of a species. We studied two lineages of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) throughout the contact zone between mesic and arid Ecozones in the Middle East to evaluate the species' response to the growing proportion of human-altered habitats in the desert. We integrated population genetics, morphometrics and movement ecology to analyse population structure, morphological variation and habitat use from GPS- or radio-tagged individuals from both desert and Mediterranean areas. We classified the spatial distribution and environmental stratification by describing physical-geographical conditions and land cover. We analysed this information to estimate patch occupancy and used an isolation-by-resistance approach to model gene flow patterns. Our results suggest that lineages from desert and Mediterranean habitats, despite their admixture, are isolated by environment and by adaptation supporting their classification as ecotypes. We found a positive effect of human-altered habitats on patch occupancy and habitat use of fruit bats by increasing the availability of roosting and foraging areas. While this commensalism promotes the distribution of fruit bats throughout the Middle East, gene flow between colonies has not been altered by human activities. This discrepancy between habitat use and gene flow patterns may, therefore, be explained by the breeding system of the species and modifications of natal dispersal patterns.",28950408
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Mitochondrial complex I bridges a connection between regulation of carbon flexibility and gastrointestinal commensalism in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans.,"Efficient assimilation of alternative carbon sources in glucose-limited host niches is critical for colonization of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that frequently causes opportunistic infection in human. C. albicans evolved mechanistically to regulate alternative carbon assimilation for the promotion of fungal growth and commensalism in mammalian hosts. However, this highly adaptive mechanism that C. albicans employs to cope with alternative carbon assimilation has yet to be clearly understood. Here we identified a novel role of C. albicans mitochondrial complex I (CI) in regulating assimilation of alternative carbon sources such as mannitol. Our data demonstrate that CI dysfunction by deleting the subunit Nuo2 decreases the level of NAD+, downregulates the NAD+-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase activity, and consequently inhibits hyphal growth and biofilm formation in conditions when the carbon source is mannitol, but not fermentative sugars like glucose. Mannitol-dependent morphogenesis is controlled by a ROS-induced signaling pathway involving Hog1 activation and Brg1 repression. In vivo studies show that nuo2/ mutant cells are severely compromised in gastrointestinal colonization and the defect can be rescued by a glucose-rich diet. Thus, our findings unravel a mechanism by which C. albicans regulates carbon flexibility and commensalism. Alternative carbon assimilation might represent a fitness advantage for commensal fungi in successful colonization of host niches.",28570675
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Promiscuous signaling by a regulatory system unique to the pandemic PMEN1 pneumococcal lineage.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a leading cause of death and disease in children and elderly. Genetic variability among isolates from this species is high. These differences, often the product of gene loss or gene acquisition via horizontal gene transfer, can endow strains with new molecular pathways, diverse phenotypes, and ecological advantages. PMEN1 is a widespread and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal lineage. Using comparative genomics we have determined that a regulator-peptide signal transduction system, TprA2/PhrA2, was acquired by a PMEN1 ancestor and is encoded by the vast majority of strains in this lineage. We show that TprA2 is a negative regulator of a PMEN1-specific gene encoding a lanthionine-containing peptide (lcpA). The activity of TprA2 is modulated by its cognate peptide, PhrA2. Expression of phrA2 is density-dependent and its C-terminus relieves TprA2-mediated inhibition leading to expression of lcpA. In the pneumococcal mouse model with intranasal inoculation, TprA2 had no effect on nasopharyngeal colonization but was associated with decreased lung disease via its control of lcpA levels. Furthermore, the TprA2/PhrA2 system has integrated into the pneumococcal regulatory circuitry, as PhrA2 activates TprA/PhrA, a second regulator-peptide signal transduction system widespread among pneumococci. Extracellular PhrA2 can release TprA-mediated inhibition, activating expression of TprA-repressed genes in both PMEN1 cells as well as another pneumococcal lineage. Acquisition of TprA2/PhrA2 has provided PMEN1 isolates with a mechanism to promote commensalism over dissemination and control inter-strain gene regulation.",28542565

By analyzing a <i>C.jejuni</i> acetogenesis mutant defective in converting acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) to acetate and commensal colonization of young chicks, we discovered evidence for <i>in vivo</i> microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and organic acids as cues recognized by <i>C.jejuni</i> that modulate expression of determinants required for commensalism. We identified a set of <i>C.jejuni</i> genes encoding catabolic enzymes and transport systems for amino acids required for <i>in vivo</i> growth whose expression was modulated by SCFAs. Transcription of these genes was reduced in the acetogenesis mutant but was restored upon supplementation with physiological concentrations of the SCFAs acetate and butyrate present in the lower intestinal tracts of avian and human hosts. Conversely, the organic acid lactate, which is abundant in the upper intestinal tract where <i>C.jejuni</i> colonizes less efficiently, reduced expression of these genes. We propose that microbiota-generated SCFAs and lactate are cues for <i>C.jejuni</i> to discriminate between different intestinal regions. Spatial gradients of these metabolites likely allow <i>C.jejuni</i> to locate preferred niches in the lower intestinal tract and induce expression of factors required for intestinal growth and commensal colonization. Our findings provide insights into the types of cues <i>C.jejuni</i> monitors in the avian host for commensalism and likely in humans to promote diarrheal disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> is a commensal of the intestinal tracts of avian species and other animals and a leading cause of diarrheal disease in humans.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",No evidence for a bovine mastitis Escherichia coli pathotype.,"Escherichia coli bovine mastitis is a disease of significant economic importance in the dairy industry. Molecular characterization of mastitis-associated E. coli (MAEC) did not result in the identification of common traits. Nevertheless, a mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) pathotype has been proposed suggesting virulence traits that differentiate MAEC from commensal E. coli. The present study was designed to investigate the MPEC pathotype hypothesis by comparing the genomes of MAEC and commensal bovine E. coli. We sequenced the genomes of eight E. coli isolated from bovine mastitis cases and six fecal commensal isolates from udder-healthy cows. We analyzed the phylogenetic history of bovine E. coli genomes by supplementing this strain panel with eleven bovine-associated E. coli from public databases. The majority of the isolates originate from phylogroups A and B1, but neither MAEC nor commensal strains could be unambiguously distinguished by phylogenetic lineage. The gene content of both MAEC and commensal strains is highly diverse and dominated by their phylogenetic background. Although individual strains carry some typical E. coli virulence-associated genes, no traits important for pathogenicity could be specifically attributed to MAEC. Instead, both commensal strains and MAEC have very few gene families enriched in either pathotype. Only the aerobactin siderophore gene cluster was enriched in commensal E. coli within our strain panel. This is the first characterization of a phylogenetically diverse strain panel including several MAEC and commensal isolates. With our comparative genomics approach we could not confirm previous studies that argue for a positive selection of specific traits enabling MAEC to elicit bovine mastitis. Instead, MAEC are facultative and opportunistic pathogens recruited from the highly diverse bovine gastrointestinal microbiota. Virulence-associated genes implicated in mastitis are a by-product of commensalism with the primary function to enhance fitness in the bovine gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we put the definition of the MPEC pathotype into question and suggest to designate corresponding isolates as MAEC.",28482799

We sequenced the whole genome of fecal H22 strain S250, compared it to the genomes of ExPEC ST131 H30-Rx strain JJ1886 and commensal ST131 H41 strain SE15, sought the H22-H30 genomic differences in our fecal strains and assessed their phenotypic consequences. We detected 173 genes found in the Virulence Factor Database, of which 148 were shared by the three ST131 genomes, whereas some were genome-specific, notably those allowing determination of virotype (D for S250 and C for JJ1886). We found three sequences of the FimH site involved in adhesion: two in S250 and SE15 close and identical, respectively, to that previously reported to confer strong intestinal adhesion, and one in JJ1886, corresponding to that commonly present in uropathogenic E. coli. Among the genes involved in sugar metabolism, one encoding a gluconate kinase lacked in S250 and JJ1886. Although this gene was also absent in both our fecal H22 and H30-R strains, H22 strains showed a higher capacity to grow in minimal medium with gluconate. Among the genes involved in gluconate metabolism, only the ghrB gene differed between S250/H22 and JJ1886/H30-R strains, resulting in different gluconate reductases. Of the genes involved in biofilm formation, two were absent in the three genomes and one, fimB, in the JJ1886 genome. Our fecal H30-R strains lacking intact fimB displayed delayed biofilm formation relative to our fecal H22 strains. The H22 strains differed by subclade B type and plasmid content, whereas the H30-R strains were identical. Phenotypic analysis of our fecal strains based on observed genomic differences between S250 and JJ1886 strains suggests the presence of traits related to bacterial commensalism in our H22 strains and traits commonly found in uropathogenic E. coli in our H30-R strains.",28347271

Complex regulatory networks, in which protein kinases play central roles, link metabolism and other virulence-associated traits, such as filamentous growth and stress resistance, and thereby control commensalism and pathogenicity. By screening a protein kinase deletion mutant library that was generated in the present work using an improved SAT1 flipper cassette, we found that the previously uncharacterised kinase Sak1 is a key upstream activator of the protein kinase Snf1, a highly conserved regulator of nutrient stress responses that is essential for viability in C. albicans. The sak1 mutants failed to grow on many alternative carbon sources and were hypersensitive to cell wall/membrane stress. These phenotypes were mirrored in mutants lacking other subunits of the SNF1 complex and partially compensated by a hyperactive form of Snf1. Transcriptional profiling of sak1 mutants showed that Sak1 ensures basal expression of glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis genes even in glucose-rich media and thereby contributes to the metabolic plasticity of C. albicans. In a mouse model of gastrointestinal colonisation, sak1 mutants were rapidly outcompeted by wild-type cells, demonstrating that Sak1 is essential for the in vivo fitness of C. albicans.",28337802

S. aureus may promote commensalism by downregulating pro-inflammatory T cell host responses via an IL-10 mediated pathway. This finding, coupled with the observation that S. aureus and CD8+ T cell numbers are inversely correlated in CRS mucosa, suggests that S. aureus may evade immune destruction via IL-10 induction. To support this hypothesis, we evaluated i) whether IL-10 levels differ in CRS compared to controls (CTL) using microarray and immunohistochemistry and ii) whether IL-10 levels correlate with S. aureus and CD8+ T cell levels. Sinus epithelial brush samples from 12 patients undergoing ESS for CRS and 10 CTLs underwent microarray analysis of IL-10 gene expression. Microarray results were verified on simultaneously obtained surgical biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry staining for IL-10. Potential mechanisms were assessed by immunohistochemistry for CD8+ T cells and S. aureus. IL-10 gene expression was significantly higher in CRS vs CTL subjects at the time of surgery. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased levels of intraepithelial IL-10. A strong inverse correlation was observed between intraepithelial IL-10 and CD8+ T cell levels as was intraepithelial IL-10 and S. aureus. Elevated IL-10 levels in sinus mucosa may be a potential pathophysiologic feature of CRS in association with a significant downregulation of host CD8+ T cell levels. While S. aureus is believed to play a role in IL-10 induction, a comparatively weaker relationship between S. aureus and IL-10 levels suggests other bacterial species may also induce IL-10 production as a common survival strategy in CRS.",28315920

There is an increased prevalence of these E. coli strains over the last 30 years in the intestinal microbiota in industrialized countries. Integrating the regulation of fitness/virulence factors, such as siderophores, colibactin and siderophore-microcins into networks that respond to specific environmental signals, such as the local iron concentration, could result in an accurate production of specific fitness/virulence factors, so that the E. coli can adapt to the competitive environment that is the gut and/or the blood. Iron deficiency is common in infancy, even in industrialized countries. Usual strategies for anemia correction are iron supplementation and iron fortification of foods. The long-term consequences and risks associated with high iron supply in the light of this iron-dependent network described in this review could explain at least in part the increased prevalence of E. coli B2 in the gut of people in industrialized countries.  2017 IUBMB Life, 69(6):435-441, 2017.",28295919

Among the diverse relationships described, extensive progress has been made in insectbacteria symbiosis, which improved our understanding of the genome evolution in host-associated bacteria. Particularly, investigations on several obligate mutualists have pushed the limits of what we know about the minimal genomes for sustaining cellular life. To bridge the gap between those obligate symbionts with extremely reduced genomes and their non-host-restricted ancestors, this review focuses on the recent progress in genome characterization of facultative insect symbionts. Notable cases representing various types and stages of host associations, including those from multiple genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae (class Gammaproteobacteria), Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria) and Spiroplasma (Mollicutes), are discussed. Although several general patterns of genome reduction associated with the adoption of symbiotic relationships could be identified, extensive variation was found among these facultative symbionts. These findings are incorporated into the established conceptual frameworks to develop a more detailed evolutionary model for the discussion of possible trajectories. In summary, transitions from facultative to obligate symbiosis do not appear to be a universal one-way street; switches between hosts and lifestyles (e.g. commensalism, parasitism or mutualism) occur frequently and could be facilitated by horizontal gene transfer.",28204477

Recent genome sequencing projects have defined the gene content of all 14 species; however, to date, genetic manipulation has not been possible for any species within this genus. Here, we develop and then optimize molecular tools for the transformation of Malassezia furfur and Malassezia sympodialis using Agrobacterium tumefaciens delivery of transfer DNA (T-DNA) molecules. These T-DNAs can insert randomly into the genome. In the case of M.furfur, targeted gene replacements were also achieved via homologous recombination, enabling deletion of the ADE2 gene for purine biosynthesis and of the LAC2 gene predicted to be involved in melanin biosynthesis. Hence, the introduction of exogenous DNA and direct gene manipulation are feasible in Malassezia species. Species in the genus Malassezia are a defining component of the microbiome of the surface of mammals. They are also associated with a wide range of skin disease symptoms. Many species are difficult to culture in vitro, and although genome sequences are available for the species in this genus, it has not been possible to assess gene function to date. In this study, we pursued a series of possible transformation methods and identified one that allows the introduction of DNA into two species of Malassezia, including the ability to make targeted integrations into the genome such that genes can be deleted. This research opens a new direction in terms of now being able to analyze gene functions in this little understood genus.

S. aureus is a clinically important pathogen that asymptomatically colonizes ~25% of humans as a member of the nostril and skin microbiota, where it resides with other bacteria including commensal Corynebacterium species. Commensal Corynebacterium spp. are also positively correlated with S. aureus in chronic polymicrobial diabetic foot infections, distinct from acute monomicrobial S. aureus infections. Recent work by our lab and others indicates that microbe-microbe interactions between S. aureus and human skin/nasal commensals, including Corynebacterium species, affect S. aureus behavior and fitness. Thus, we hypothesized that S. aureus interactions with Corynebacterium spp. diminish S. aureus virulence. We tested this by assaying for changes in S. aureus gene expression during in vitro mono- versus coculture with Corynebacterium striatum, a common skin and nasal commensal. We observed a broad shift in S. aureus gene transcription during in vitro growth with C. striatum, including increased transcription of genes known to exhibit increased expression during human nasal colonization and decreased transcription of virulence genes. S. aureus uses several regulatory pathways to transition between commensal and pathogenic states. One of these, the quorum signal accessory gene regulator (agr) system, was strongly inhibited in response to Corynebacterium spp. Phenotypically, S. aureus exposed to C. striatum exhibited increased adhesion to epithelial cells, reflecting a commensal state, and decreased hemolysin activity, reflecting an attenuation of virulence. Consistent with this, S. aureus displayed diminished fitness in experimental in vivo coinfection with C. striatum when compared to monoinfection.

Until now, the biology of living animals has not been reported. In this study, we found T. fujitaniana in a commensal relationship with the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum (Pennant, 1777) (Spatangoida, Echinoidea) on the intertidal mud flats of the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. We investigated the morphology, host associations, and reproductive biology of this bivalve species. The elongate-ovate shell is covered by a reddish-brown ferruginous deposit. The mantle is exposed anteriorly to form a temporal siphon, while posteriorly one pair of short tentacles is exposed. Small individuals (shell length, SL,  2.1 mm) were attached to the host's body surface; middle-sized individuals (SL 3.0-3.2 mm) were attached to or stayed close to larger T. fujitanianathat were living freely in the host burrow. Nearly all the large individuals (SL  4.8 mm) lived freely in the host burrow, behind the urchin. This suggests that the host utilization pattern of T. fujitanianachanges with development. Specimens with SL  4.8 mm had mature gonads, mostly occupied by ova, and some individuals were brooding eggs or veliger larvae in the gills. This species was previously assigned to Fronsella. However, the morphology and ecology of this bivalve are very similar to those of Tellimya ferruginosa (the type species of the genus Tellimya) in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean.

ABU strains often lack the virulence factors that characterize uropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains and therefore elicit weak innate immune responses in the urinary tract. In addition, ABU strains are active modifiers of the host environment, which they influence by suppressing RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent host gene expression. In patients inoculated with the ABU strain E. coli 83972, gene expression was markedly reduced after 24 h (>60% of all regulated genes). Specific repressors and activators of Pol II-dependent transcription were modified, and Pol II Serine 2 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited, indicating reduced activity of the polymerase. This active inhibition included disease-associated innate immune response pathways, defined by TLR4, IRF-3 and IRF-7, suggesting that ABU strains persist in human hosts by active suppression of the antibacterial defense. In a search for the mechanism of inhibition, we compared the whole genome sequences of E. coli 83972 and the uropathogenic strain E. coli CFT073. In addition to the known loss of virulence genes, we observed that the ABU strain has acquired several phages and identified the lytic Prophage 3 as a candidate Pol II inhibitor. Intact phage particles were released by ABU during in vitro growth in human urine. To address if Prophage 3 affects Pol II activity, we constructed a Prophage 3 negative deletion mutant in E. coli 83972 and compared the effect on Pol II phosphorylation between the mutant and the E. coli 83972 wild type (WT) strains. No difference was detected, suggesting that the Pol II inhibitor is not encoded by the phage.

The pioneer bacteria colonizing the postnatal intestinal tract profoundly contribute to the establishment of the host-microbe symbiosis, which is essential for health throughout life. Escherichia coli is one of the first colonizers of the gut after birth. E. coli is a versatile population including harmless commensal, probiotic strains as well as frequently deadly pathogens. The prevalence of the specific phylogenetic B2 group, which encompasses both commensal and extra- or intraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, is increasing among E. coli strains colonizing infants quickly after birth. Fifty percent of the B2 group strains carry in their genome the pks gene cluster encoding the synthesis of a nonribosomal peptide-polyketide hybrid genotoxin named colibactin.

The aim of this work was to determine how a host detects the presence of a new UPEC strain in the digestive tract. Mice were orally challenged with UPEC strains 536 and CFT073, non-pathogenic strain K12 MG1655, and PAI-536, an isogenic mutant of strain 536 lacking all 7 pathogenicity islands whose virulence is drastically attenuated. Intestinal colonization was measured, and cytokine expression was determined in various organs recovered from mice after oral challenge. UPEC strain 536 efficiently colonized the mouse digestive tract, and prior Enterobacteriaceae colonization was found to impact strain 536 colonization efficiency. An innate immune response, detected as the production of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines, was activated in the ileum 48 hours after oral challenge with strain 536, and returned to baseline within 8 days, without a drop in fecal pathogen load. Although inflammation was detected in the ileum, histology was normal at the time of cytokine peak. Comparison of cytokine secretion 48h after oral gavage with E. coli strain 536, CFT073, MG1655 or PAI-536 showed that inflammation was more pronounced with UPECs than with non-pathogenic or attenuated strains. Pathogenicity islands also seemed to be involved in host detection, as IL-6 intestinal secretion was increased after administration of E. coli strain 536, but not after administration of PAI-536. In conclusion, UPEC colonization of the mouse digestive tract activates acute phase inflammatory cytokine secretion but does not trigger any pathological changes, illustrating the opportunistic nature of UPECs.

Atherosclerosis-susceptible LDL receptor-deficient mice were administered intraperitoneal HK-SA twice weekly and fed a Western-type diet for 6 weeks. HK-SA administration resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in IL-10 production by peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes, and a 12-fold increase in serum IL-10 levels. Moreover, aortic plaque ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and CCL2 expression levels were significantly downregulated by on average 40%. HK-SA-treated mice had reduced numbers of inflammatory Ly-6C(hi) monocytes as well as Th1 and Th17 cells in the circulation and spleen, respectively. Attenuated leucocyte recruitment resulted in a significant inhibition of macrophage and T cell infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques, culminating in a significant 34% reduction in the development of atherosclerosis. To determine the effects of intraperitoneal HK-SA treatment, we stimulated macrophages with HK-SA in vitro. This resulted in a significant toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent increase in IL-10, arginase-1, iNOS, TNF-, PD-L1, CCL22 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression. It was found that phosphoinositide 3-kinase crucially determined the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression. The HK-SA-induced macrophage phenotype resembled M2b-like immunoregulatory macrophages. We have shown that HK-SA treatment induces strong anti-inflammatory IL-10 responses by macrophages, which are largely dependent on TLR2 and PI3K, and protects against the development of atherosclerosis.

We show here that the RNA binding protein Puf3 regulates a posttranscriptional mRNA network in C. albicans that impacts on mitochondrial biogenesis, and provide the first functional data suggesting evolutionary rewiring of posttranscriptional gene regulation between the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans. A proportion of the Puf3 mRNA network is differentially expressed in biofilms, and by using a mutant in the mRNA deadenylase CCR4 (the enzyme recruited to mRNAs by Puf3 to control transcript stability) we show that posttranscriptional regulation is important for mitochondrial regulation in biofilms. Inactivation of CCR4 or dis-regulation of mitochondrial activity led to altered biofilm structure and over-production of extracellular matrix material. The extracellular matrix is critical for antifungal resistance and immune evasion, and yet of all biofilm maturation pathways extracellular matrix biogenesis is the least understood. We propose a model in which the hypoxic biofilm environment is sensed by regulators such as Ccr4 to orchestrate metabolic adaptation, as well as the regulation of extracellular matrix production by impacting on the expression of matrix-related cell wall genes. Therefore metabolic changes in biofilms might be intimately linked to a key biofilm maturation mechanism that ultimately results in untreatable fungal disease.",26474309

Here we used metatranscriptomics to determine the functional shift from health to periodontitis, the response of individual species to dysbiosis and to discover biomarkers. Sixteen individuals were studied, from which six were diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Illumina sequencing of the total messenger RNA (mRNA) yielded ~42 million reads per sample. A total of 324 human oral taxon phylotypes and 366,055 open reading frames from the HOMD database reference genomes were detected. The transcriptionally active community shifted from Bacilli and Actinobacteria in health to Bacteroidia, Deltaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Synergistetes in periodontitis. Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) related to carbohydrate transport and catabolism dominated in health, whereas protein degradation and amino acid catabolism dominated in disease. The LEfSe, random forest and support vector machine methods were applied to the 2,000 most highly expressed genes and discovered the three best functional biomarkers, namely haem binding protein HmuY from <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>, flagellar filament core protein FlaB3 from <i>Treponema denticola</i>, and repeat protein of unknown function from <i>Filifactor alocis.</i> They predicted the diagnosis correctly for 14 from 16 individuals, and when applied to an independent study misclassified one out of six subjects only. <i>Prevotella nigrescens</i> shifted from commensalism to virulence by upregulating the expression of metalloproteases and the haem transporter. Expression of genes for the synthesis of the cytotoxic short-chain fatty acid butyrate was observed by <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> under all conditions. Four additional species contributed to butyrate synthesis in periodontitis and they used an additional pathway. Gene biomarkers of periodontitis are highly predictive. The pro-inflammatory role of <i>F. nucelatum</i> is not related to butyrate synthesis.",28721234

Rice responds to ecologically distinct bacteria by altering its content of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Plants' growth and physiology are strongly influenced by the biotic interactions that plants establish with soil bacterial populations. Plants are able to sense and to respond accordingly to ecologically distinct bacteria, by inducing defense pathways against pathogens to prevent parasitic interactions, and by stimulating the growth of root-associated beneficial or commensal bacteria through root exudation. Plant secondary metabolism is expected to play a major role in this control. However, secondary metabolite responses of a same plant to cooperative, commensal and deleterious bacteria have so far never been compared. The impact of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) Azospirillum lipoferum 4B on the secondary metabolite profiles of two Oryza sativa L. cultivars (Cigalon and Nipponbare) was compared to that of a rice pathogen Burkholderia glumae AU6208, the causing agent of bacterial panicle blight and of a commensal environmental bacteria Escherichia coli B6. Root and shoot rice extracts were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Principal component analyses (PCAs) pinpointed discriminant secondary metabolites, which were characterized by mass spectrometry. Direct comparison of metabolic profiles evidenced that each bacterial ecological interaction induced distinct qualitative and quantitative modifications of rice secondary metabolism, by altering the content of numerous flavonoid compounds and hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives. Secondary metabolism varied according to the cultivars and the interaction types, demonstrating the relevance of secondary metabolic profiling for studying plant-bacteria biotic interactions.",26303982

We report the case of an RNA attenuating virulence and host uptake, possibly to sustain commensalism. A S. aureus sRNA, SprC (srn_3610), reduced virulence and bacterial loads in a mouse infection model. S. aureus deleted for sprC became more virulent and increased bacterial dissemination in colonized animals. Conversely, inducing SprC expression lowered virulence and the bacterial load. Without sprC, S. aureus phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages was higher, whereas bacteria were internalized at lower yields when SprC expression was stimulated. Without sprC, higher internalization led to a greater number of extracellular bacteria, facilitating colonization. SprC expression decreased after phagocytosis, concurring with the facilitated growth of bacteria lacking the sRNA in the presence of an oxidant. The major staphylococcal autolysin facilitates S. aureus uptake by human phagocytes. ATL proved to be negatively regulated by SprC. The SprC domains involved in pairing with atl mRNA were analyzed. The addition of ATL reduced phagocytosis of bacteria lacking sprC with no effects on wild-type bacterial uptake, implying that SprC influences phagocytosis, at least in part, by controlling ATL. Since the control of SprC on ATL was modest, other factors must contribute to atl regulation.",26240382

A wide spectrum of microbes frequently occurs in Genlisea's leaf-derived traps without clear relevance for Genlisea carnivory. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of subterrestrial traps vs. the aerial chlorophyll-containing leaves of G. nigrocaulis and of G. hispidula. Ribosomal RNA assignment revealed soil-borne microbial diversity in Genlisea traps, with 92 genera of 19 phyla present in more than one sample. Microbes from 16 of these phyla including proteobacteria, green algae, amoebozoa, fungi, ciliates and metazoans, contributed additionally short-lived mRNA to the metatranscriptome. Furthermore, transcripts of 438 members of hydrolases (e.g., proteases, phosphatases, lipases), mainly resembling those of metazoans, ciliates and green algae, were found. Compared to aerial leaves, Genlisea traps displayed a transcriptional up-regulation of endogenous NADH oxidases generating reactive oxygen species as well as of acid phosphatases for prey digestion. A leaf-vs.-trap transcriptome comparison reflects that carnivory provides inorganic P- and different forms of N-compounds (ammonium, nitrate, amino acid, oligopeptides) and implies the need to protect trap cells against oxidative stress. The analysis elucidates a complex food web inside the Genlisea traps, and suggests ecological relationships between this plant genus and its entrapped microbiome.",26236284

Here, we combine in vitro ligand binding, quantitative gene expression, protein-DNA interaction and ligand structure activity analyses together with in silico modeling of the AHR ligand binding domain to identify indole, a microbial tryptophan metabolite, as a human-AHR selective agonist. Human AHR, acting as a host indole receptor may exhibit a unique bimolecular (2:1) binding stoichiometry not observed with typical AHR ligands.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary Transition from Pathogenicity to Commensalism: Global Regulator Mutations Mediate Fitness Gains through Virulence Attenuation.,"Symbiotic interactions are indispensable for metazoan function, but their origin and evolution remain elusive. We use a controlled evolution experiment to demonstrate the emergence of novel commensal interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an initially pathogenic bacterium, and a metazoan host, Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that commensalism evolves through loss of virulence, because it provides bacteria with a double fitness advantage: Increased within-host fitness and a larger host population to infect. Commensalism arises irrespective of host immune status, as the adaptive path in immunocompromised C. elegans knockouts does not differ from that in wild type. Dissection of temporal dynamics of genomic adaptation for 125 bacterial populations reveals highly parallel evolution of incipient commensalism across independent biological replicates. Adaptation is mainly achieved through frame shift mutations in the global regulator lasR and nonsynonymous point mutations in the polymerase gene rpoB that arise early in evolution. Genetic knockouts of lasR not only corroborate its role in virulence attenuation but also show that further mutations are necessary for the fully commensal phenotype. The evolutionary transition from pathogenicity to commensalism as we observe here is facilitated by mutations in global regulators such as lasR, because few genetic changes cause pleiotropic effects across the genome with large phenotypic effects. Finally, we found that nucleotide diversity increased more quickly in bacteria adapting to immunocompromised hosts than in those adapting to immunocompetent hosts. Nevertheless, the outcome of evolution was comparable across host types. Commensalism can thus evolve independently of host immune state solely as a side-effect of bacterial adaptation to novel hosts.",26199376

Here we report that mutants of bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor unable to produce desferrioxamine siderophores could recover growth when the plates were contaminated by indoor air spores of a Penicillium species and Engyodontium album. UPLC-ESI-MS analysis revealed that the HPLC fractions with the extracellular 'resuscitation' factors of the Penicillium isolate were only those that contained siderophores, i.e. Fe-dimerum acid, ferrichrome, fusarinine C and coprogen. The restored growth of the Streptomyces mutants devoid of desferrioxamine is most likely mediated through xenosiderophore uptake as the cultivability depends on the gene encoding the ABC-transporter-associated DesE siderophore-binding protein. That a filamentous fungus allows the growth of desferrioxamine non-producing Streptomyces in cocultures confirms that xenosiderophore piracy plays a vital role in nutritional interactions between these taxonomically unrelated filamentous microorganisms.",26183915

We previously identified the enterococcal leucine-rich protein A (ElrA) as a virulence factor of E. faecalis. The elrA gene is part of an operon that comprises four other ORFs encoding putative surface proteins of unknown function. In this work, we compared the susceptibility to phagocytosis of three E. faecalis strains, including a wild-type (WT), a elrA strain, and a strain overexpressing the whole elr operon in order to understand the role of this operon in E. faecalis virulence. While both WT and elrA strains were efficiently phagocytized by RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, the elr operon-overexpressing strain showed a decreased capability to be internalized by the phagocytic cells. Consistently, the strain overexpressing elr operon was less adherent to macrophages than the WT strain, suggesting that overexpression of the elr operon could confer E. faecalis with additional anti-adhesion properties. In addition, increased virulence of the elr operon-overexpressing strain was shown in a mouse peritonitis model. Altogether, our results indicate that overexpression of the elr operon facilitates the E. faecalis escape from host immune defenses.",26003173
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Commensalism facilitates gene flow in mountains: a comparison between two Rattus species.,"Small mammal dispersal is strongly affected by geographical barriers. However, commensal small mammals may be passively transported over large distances and strong barriers by humans (often with agricultural products). This pattern should be especially apparent in topographically complex landscapes, such as mountain ranges, where valleys and/or peaks can limit dispersal of less vagile species. We predict that commensal species would have lower genetic differentiation and higher migration rates than related non-commensals in such landscapes. We contrasted population genetic differentiation in two sympatric Rattus species (R. satarae and R. rattus) in the Western Ghats mountains in southern India. We sampled rats from villages and adjacent forests in seven locations (20-640 km apart). Capture-based statistics confirmed that R. rattus is abundant in human settlements in this region, whereas R. satarae is non-commensal and found mostly in forests. Population structure analyses using ~970-bp mitochondrial control region and 17 microsatellite loci revealed higher differentiation for the non-commensal species (R. satarae F-statistics=0.420, 0.065, R. rattus F-statistics=0.195, 0.034; mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites, respectively). Genetic clustering analyses confirm that clusters in R. satarae are more distinct and less admixed than those in R. rattus. R. satarae shows higher slope for isolation-by-distance compared with R. rattus. Although mode of migration estimates do not strongly suggest higher rates in R. rattus than in R. satarae, they indicate that migration over long distances could still be higher in R. rattus. We suggest that association with humans could drive the observed pattern of differentiation in the commensal R. rattus, consequently impacting not only their dispersal abilities, but also their evolutionary trajectories.",25944468

The virulence of 28 E. faecalis isolates representing 24 multilocus sequence types (MLSTs), including human commensal and clinical isolates as well as isolates from animals and of insect origin, was investigated using C. elegans strain glp-4 (bn2ts); sek-1 (km4). This revealed that 6 E. faecalis isolates behaved in a commensal manner with no nematocidal effect, while the remaining strains showed a time to 50% lethality ranging from 47 to 120 h. Principal component analysis showed that the difference in nematocidal activity explained 94% of the variance in the data. Assessment of known virulence traits revealed that gelatinase and cytolysin production accounted for 40.8% and 36.5% of the observed pathogenicity, respectively. However, coproduction of gelatinase and cytolysin did not increase virulence additively, accounting for 50.6% of the pathogenicity and therefore indicating a significant (26.7%) saturation effect. We employed a comparative genomic analysis approach using the 28 isolates comprising a collection of 82,356 annotated coding sequences (CDS) to identify 2,325 patterns of presence or absence among the investigated strains. Univariate statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) established that individual patterns positively correlated (n = 61) with virulence. The patterns were investigated to identify potential new virulence traits, among which we found five patterns consisting of the phage03-like gene clusters. Strains harboring phage03 showed, on average, 17% higher killing of C. elegans (P = 4.4e(-6)). The phage03 gene cluster was also present in gelatinase-and-cytolysin-negative strain E. faecalis JH2-2. Deletion of this phage element from the JH2-2 clinical strain rendered the mutant apathogenic in C. elegans, and a similar mutant of the nosocomial V583 isolate showed significantly attenuated virulence. Bioinformatics investigation indicated that, unlike other E. faecalis virulence traits, phage03-like elements were found at a higher frequency among nosocomial isolates. In conclusion, our report provides a valuable virulence map that explains enhancement in E. faecalis virulence and contributes to a deeper comprehension of the genetic mechanism leading to the transition from commensalism to a pathogenic lifestyle.",25776747
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Variation in siderophore biosynthetic gene distribution and production across environmental and faecal populations of Escherichia coli.,"Iron is essential for Escherichia coli growth and survival in the host and the external environment, but its availability is generally low due to the poor solubility of its ferric form in aqueous environments and the presence of iron-withholding proteins in the host. Most E. coli can increase access to iron by excreting siderophores such as enterobactin, which have a very strong affinity for Fe3+. A smaller proportion of isolates can generate up to 3 additional siderophores linked with pathogenesis; aerobactin, salmochelin, and yersiniabactin. However, non-pathogenic E. coli are also able to synthesise these virulence-associated siderophores. This raises questions about their role in the ecology of E. coli, beyond virulence, and whether specific siderophores might be linked with persistence in the external environment. Under the assumption that selection favours phenotypes that confer a fitness advantage, we compared siderophore production and gene distribution in E. coli isolated either from agricultural plants or the faeces of healthy mammals. This population-level comparison has revealed that under iron limiting growth conditions plant-associated isolates produced lower amounts of siderophores than faecal isolates. Additionally, multiplex PCR showed that environmental isolates were less likely to contain loci associated with aerobactin and yersiniabactin synthesis. Although aerobactin was linked with strong siderophore excretion, a significant difference in production was still observed between plant and faecal isolates when the analysis was restricted to strains only able to synthesise enterobactin. This finding suggests that the regulatory response to iron limitation may be an important trait associated with adaptation to the non-host environment. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the ability to produce multiple siderophores facilitates E. coli gut colonisation and plays an important role in E. coli commensalism.",25756870

One extreme of UTI is asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which occurs as an asymptomatic carrier state that resembles commensalism. To understand the evolution and molecular mechanisms that underpin ABU, the genome of the ABU E. coli strain VR50 was sequenced. Analysis of the complete genome indicated that it most resembles E. coli K-12, with the addition of a 94-kb genomic island (GI-VR50-pheV), eight prophages, and multiple plasmids. GI-VR50-pheV has a mosaic structure and contains genes encoding a number of UTI-associated virulence factors, namely, Afa (afimbrial adhesin), two autotransporter proteins (Ag43 and Sat), and aerobactin. We demonstrated that the presence of this island in VR50 confers its ability to colonize the murine bladder, as a VR50 mutant with GI-VR50-pheV deleted was attenuated in a mouse model of UTI in vivo. We established that Afa is the island-encoded factor responsible for this phenotype using two independent deletion (Afa operon and AfaE adhesin) mutants. E. coli VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed significantly decreased ability to adhere to human bladder epithelial cells. In the mouse model of UTI, VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed reduced bladder colonization compared to wild-type VR50, similar to the colonization level of the GI-VR50-pheV mutant. Our study suggests that E. coli VR50 is a commensal-like strain that has acquired fitness factors that facilitate colonization of the human bladder.",25667270

N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is an important signaling molecule as well as a carbon source in C. albicans. Here, we report the discovery of a novel gene MCU1 essential for GlcNAc utilization. Mcu1 is located in mitochondria and associated with multiple energy- and metabolism-related proteins including Por1, Atp1, Pet9, and Mdh1. Consistently, inactivating Por1 impaired GlcNAc utilization as well. Deletion of MCU1 also caused defects in utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources and amino acids. Furthermore, MCU1 is required for filamentation in several inducing conditions and virulence in a mouse systemic infection model. We also deleted TGL99 and GUP1, two genes adjacent to MCU1, and found that the gup1/gup1 mutant exhibited mild defects in the utilization of several carbon sources including GlcNAc, maltose, galactose, amino acids, and ethanol. Our results indicate that MCU1 exists in a cluster of genes involved in the metabolism of carbon sources. Given its importance in metabolism and lack of a homolog in humans, Mcu1 could be a potential target for developing antifungal agents.",25626172
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Cell cycle-independent phospho-regulation of Fkh2 during hyphal growth regulates Candida albicans pathogenesis.,"The opportunistic human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. Although previous gene-knockout studies have identified many factors involved in this transformation, it remains unclear how these factors are regulated to coordinate the switch. Investigating morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation has generated important regulatory insights into this process, especially focusing on coordinated control by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Here we have identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. In stationary phase yeast cells 2D gel electrophoresis shows that there is a diverse pool of Fkh2 phospho-isoforms. For a short window on hyphal induction, far before START in the cell cycle, the phosphorylation profile is transformed before reverting to the yeast profile. This transformation does not occur when stationary phase cells are reinoculated into fresh medium supporting yeast growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1. Substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction and biofilm formation. We confirmed that these changes in gene expression resulted in corresponding defects in pathogenic processes. Furthermore, we identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, thereby providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. Thus, we have discovered a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.",25617770

To examine diversity within this species, extensive genomic and phenotypic analyses were performed on 21 clinical C. albicans isolates. Genomic variation was evident in the form of polymorphisms, copy number variations, chromosomal inversions, subtelomeric hypervariation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and whole or partial chromosome aneuploidies. All 21 strains were diploid, although karyotypic changes were present in eight of the 21 isolates, with multiple strains being trisomic for Chromosome 4 or Chromosome 7. Aneuploid strains exhibited a general fitness defect relative to euploid strains when grown under replete conditions. All strains were also heterozygous, yet multiple, distinct LOH tracts were present in each isolate. Higher overall levels of genome heterozygosity correlated with faster growth rates, consistent with increased overall fitness. Genes with the highest rates of amino acid substitutions included many cell wall proteins, implicating fast evolving changes in cell adhesion and host interactions. One clinical isolate, P94015, presented several striking properties including a novel cellular phenotype, an inability to filament, drug resistance, and decreased virulence. Several of these properties were shown to be due to a homozygous nonsense mutation in the EFG1 gene. Furthermore, loss of EFG1 function resulted in increased fitness of P94015 in a commensal model of infection. Our analysis therefore reveals intra-species genetic and phenotypic differences in C. albicans and delineates a natural mutation that alters the balance between commensalism and pathogenicity.",25504520

In Manduca sexta, E. faecalis is an infrequent member of the commensal gut community, but its translocation to the hemocoel results in a commensal-to-pathogen switch. To investigate E. faecalis factors required for commensalism, we identified E. faecalis genes that are upregulated in the gut of M. sexta using recombinase-based in vivo expression technology (RIVET). The RIVET screen produced 113 clones, from which we identified 50 genes that are more highly expressed in the insect gut than in culture. The most frequently recovered gene was locus OG1RF_11582, which encodes a 6-phosphogluconolactonase that we designated pglA. A pglA deletion mutant was impaired in both pathogenesis and gut persistence in M. sexta and produced enhanced biofilms compared with the wild type in an in vitro polystyrene plate assay. Mutation of four other genes identified by RIVET did not affect persistence in caterpillar guts but led to impaired pathogenesis. This is the first identification of genetic determinants for E. faecalis commensal and pathogenic interactions with M. sexta.

Strains belonging to the B2 group are involved in extra-intestinal pathologies but also appear to be more prevalent as commensals among human occidental populations. To investigate the genetic specificities of B2 sub-group, we used 128 sequenced genomes and identified genes of the core genome that showed marked difference between B2 and non-B2 genomes. We focused on the gene and its surrounding region with the strongest divergence between B2 and non-B2, the antiporter gene nhaA. This gene is part of the nhaAR operon, which is in the core genome but flanked by mobile regions, and is involved in growth at high pH and high sodium concentrations. Consistently, we found that a panel of non-B2 strains grew faster than B2 at high pH and high sodium concentrations. However, we could not identify differences in expression of the nhaAR operon using fluorescence reporter plasmids. Furthermore, the operon deletion had no differential impact between B2 and non-B2 strains, and did not result in a fitness modification in a murine model of gut colonization. Nevertheless, sequence analysis and experiments in a murine model of septicemia revealed that recombination in nhaA among B2 strains was observed in strains with low virulence. Finally, nhaA and nhaAR operon deletions drastically decreased virulence in one B2 strain. This effect of nhaAR deletion appeared to be stronger than deletion of all pathogenicity islands. Thus, a population genetic approach allowed us to identify an operon in the core genome without strong effect in commensalism but with an important role in extra-intestinal virulence, a landmark of the B2 strains.",25268639
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Membership and behavior of ultra-low-diversity pathogen communities present in the gut of humans during prolonged critical illness.,"We analyzed the 16S rRNA amplicon composition in fecal samples of selected patients during their prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) and observed the emergence of ultra-low-diversity communities (1 to 4 bacterial taxa) in 30% of the patients. Bacteria associated with the genera Enterococcus and Staphylococcus and the family Enterobacteriaceae comprised the majority of these communities. The composition of cultured species from stool samples correlated to the 16S rRNA analysis and additionally revealed the emergence of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in ~75% of cases. Four of 14 ICU patients harbored 2-member pathogen communities consisting of one Candida taxon and one bacterial taxon. Bacterial members displayed a high degree of resistance to multiple antibiotics. The virulence potential of the 2-member communities was examined in C. elegans during nutrient deprivation and exposure to opioids in order to mimic local conditions in the gut during critical illness. Under conditions of nutrient deprivation, the bacterial members attenuated the virulence of fungal members, leading to a ""commensal lifestyle."" However, exposure to opioids led to a breakdown in this commensalism in 2 of the ultra-low-diversity communities. Application of a novel antivirulence agent (phosphate-polyethylene glycol [Pi-PEG]) that creates local phosphate abundance prevented opioid-induced virulence among these pathogen communities, thus rescuing the commensal lifestyle. To conclude, the gut microflora in critically ill patients can consist of ultra-low-diversity communities of multidrug-resistant pathogenic microbes. Local environmental conditions in gut may direct pathogen communities to adapt to either a commensal style or a pathogenic style. During critical illness, the normal gut microbiota becomes disrupted in response to host physiologic stress and antibiotic treatment. Here we demonstrate that the community structure of the gut microbiota during prolonged critical illness is dramatically changed such that in many cases only two-member pathogen communities remain. Most of these ultra-low-membership communities display low virulence when grouped together (i.e., a commensal lifestyle); individually, however, they can express highly harmful behaviors (i.e., a pathogenic lifestyle). The commensal lifestyle of the whole community can be shifted to a pathogenic one in response to host factors such as opioids that are released during physiologic stress and critical illness. This shift can be prevented by using compounds such as Pi-PEG15-20 that interrupt bacterial virulence expression. Taking the data together, this report characterizes the plasticity seen with respect to the choice between a commensal lifestyle and a pathogenic lifestyle among ultra-low-diversity pathogen communities that predominate in the gut during critical illness and offers novel strategies for prevention of sepsis.",25249279
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Structural modifications of Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide: an idea for how to live in peace.,"In this review, we discuss the findings and concepts underlying the ""persistence mechanisms"" of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a spiral-shaped, Gram-negative rod bacterium that was discovered as a gastric pathogen by Marshall and Warren in 1984. H. pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of nearly half of the human population. Infections appear in early childhood and, if not treated, persist for life. The presence or absence of symptoms and their severity depend on multiple bacterial components, host susceptibility and environmental factors, which allow H. pylori to switch between pathogenicity and commensalism. Many studies have shown that H. pylori components may facilitate the colonization process and the immune response of the host during the course of H. pylori infection. These H. pylori-driven interactions might result from positive or negative modulation. Among the negative immunomodulators, a prominent position is occupied by a vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein. However, in light of the recent studies that are presented in this review, it is necessary to enrich this panel with H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Together with CagA and VacA, LPS suppresses the elimination of H. pylori bacteria from the gastric mucosa by interfering with the activity of innate and adaptive immune cells, diminishing the inflammatory response, and affecting the adaptive T lymphocyte response, thus facilitating the development of chronic infections. The complex strategy of H. pylori bacteria for survival in the gastric mucosa of the host involves both structural modifications of LPS lipid A to diminish its endotoxic properties and the expression and variation of Lewis determinants, arranged in O-specific chains of H. pylori LPS. By mimicking host components, this phenomenon leaves these bacteria ""invisible"" to immune cells. Together, these mechanisms allow H. pylori to survive and live for many years within their hosts.",25110419
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Functional genomics of Lactobacillus casei establishment in the gut.,"Although the composition of the gut microbiota and its symbiotic contribution to key host physiological functions are well established, little is known as yet about the bacterial factors that account for this symbiosis. We selected Lactobacillus casei as a model microorganism to proceed to genomewide identification of the functions required for a symbiont to establish colonization in the gut. As a result of our recent development of a transposon-mutagenesis tool that overcomes the barrier that had prevented L. casei random mutagenesis, we developed a signature-tagged mutagenesis approach combining whole-genome reverse genetics using a set of tagged transposons and in vivo screening using the rabbit ligated ileal loop model. After sequencing transposon insertion sites in 9,250 random mutants, we assembled a library of 1,110 independent mutants, all disrupted in a different gene, that provides a representative view of the L. casei genome. By determining the relative quantity of each of the 1,110 mutants before and after the in vivo challenge, we identified a core of 47 L. casei genes necessary for its establishment in the gut. They are involved in housekeeping functions, metabolism (sugar, amino acids), cell wall biogenesis, and adaptation to environment. Hence we provide what is, to our knowledge, the first global functional genomics analysis of L. casei symbiosis.",25024222
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",A non-coding RNA promotes bacterial persistence and decreases virulence by regulating a regulator in Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus produces a high number of RNAs for which the functions are poorly understood. Several non-coding RNAs carry a C-rich sequence suggesting that they regulate mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. We demonstrate that the Sigma B-dependent RsaA RNA represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. These two recognition sites are required for translation repression. Consequently, RsaA causes enhanced production of biofilm and a decreased synthesis of capsule formation in several strain backgrounds. These phenotypes led to a decreased protection of S. aureus against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to the mutant strains lacking RsaA. Mice animal models showed that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection. RsaA takes part in a regulatory network that contributes to the complex interactions of S. aureus with the host immune system to moderate invasiveness and favour chronic infections. It is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. Because S. aureus is essentially a human commensal, we propose that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host.",24651379
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",The coevolutionary implications of host tolerance.,"Host tolerance to infectious disease, whereby hosts do not directly ""fight"" parasites but instead ameliorate the damage caused, is an important defense mechanism in both plants and animals. Because tolerance to parasite virulence may lead to higher prevalence of disease in a population, evolutionary theory tells us that while the spread of resistance genes will result in negative frequency dependence and the potential for diversification, the evolution of tolerance is instead likely to result in fixation. However, our understanding of the broader implications of tolerance is limited by a lack of fully coevolutionary theory. Here we examine the coevolution of tolerance across a comprehensive range of classic coevolutionary host-parasite frameworks, including equivalents of gene-for-gene and matching allele and evolutionary invasion models. Our models show that the coevolution of host tolerance and parasite virulence does not lead to the generation and maintenance of diversity through either static polymorphisms or through ""Red-queen"" cycles. Coevolution of tolerance may however lead to multiple stable states leading to sudden shifts in parasite impacts on host health. More broadly, we emphasize that tolerance may change host-parasite interactions from antagonistic to a form of ""apparent commensalism,"" but may also lead to the evolution of parasites that are highly virulent in nontolerant hosts.",24475902

Recent studies have revealed that the status of gastrointestinal tract microbiota can influence nutrition-related syndromes such as obesity and type-2 diabetes, and perhaps aging. These morbidities have a profound impact in terms of individual suffering, and are an increasing economic burden to modern societies. Several theories have been proposed for the influence of microbiota on host metabolism, but these largely remain to be proven. In this article we discuss how microbiota may be manipulated (via pharmacology, diet, or gene manipulation) in order to alter metabolism, immunity, health and aging in the host. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in combination with one microbial species is an excellent, defined model system to investigate the mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions, particularly given the combined power of worm and microbial genetics. We also discuss the multifaceted nature of the worm-microbe relationship, which likely encompasses predation, commensalism, pathogenicity and necromeny.",23913848
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Passage through the mammalian gut triggers a phenotypic switch that promotes Candida albicans commensalism.,"Among 5,000,000 fungal species, C. albicans is exceptional in its lifelong association with humans, either within the gastrointestinal microbiome or as an invasive pathogen. Opportunistic infections are generally ascribed to defective host immunity but may require specific microbial programs. Here we report that exposure of C. albicans to the mammalian gut triggers a developmental switch, driven by the Wor1 transcription factor, to a commensal cell type. Wor1 expression was previously observed only in rare genetic backgrounds, where it controls a white-opaque switch in mating. We show that passage of wild-type cells through the mouse gastrointestinal tract triggers WOR1 expression and a novel phenotypic switch. The resulting GUT (gastrointestinally induced transition) cells differ morphologically and functionally from previously defined cell types, including opaque cells, and express a transcriptome that is optimized for the digestive tract. The white-GUT switch illuminates how a microorganism can use distinct genetic programs to transition between commensalism and invasive pathogenesis.",23892606
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Comparative Genomic Analyses of Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae Provide Insight into Virulence and Commensalism Dynamics.,"Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (SPPN) is a recently described species of the viridans group streptococci (VGS). Although the pathogenic potential of S. pseudopneumoniae remains uncertain, it is most commonly isolated from patients with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. S. pseudopneumoniae can be distinguished from the closely related species, S. pneumoniae and S. mitis, by phenotypic characteristics, including optochin resistance in the presence of 5% CO2, bile insolubility, and the lack of the pneumococcal capsule. Previously, we reported the draft genome sequence of S. pseudopneumoniae IS7493, a clinical isolate obtained from an immunocompromised patient with documented pneumonia. Here, we use comparative genomics approaches to identify similarities and key differences between S. pseudopneumoniae IS7493, S. pneumoniae and S. mitis. The genome structure of S. pseudopneumoniae IS7493 is most closely related to that of S. pneumoniae R6, but several recombination events are evident. Analysis of gene content reveals numerous unique features that distinguish S. pseudopneumoniae from other streptococci. The presence of loci for competence, iron transport, pneumolysin production and antimicrobial resistance reinforce the phylogenetic position of S. pseudopneumoniae as an intermediate species between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis. Additionally, the presence of several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms suggest the potential of this commensal species to become pathogenic or to contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance levels seen among the VGS.",23840352
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Bacterial control of host gene expression through RNA polymerase II.,"The normal flora furnishes the host with ecological barriers that prevent pathogen attack while maintaining tissue homeostasis. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) constitute a highly relevant model of microbial adaptation in which some patients infected with Escherichia coli develop acute pyelonephritis, while other patients with bacteriuria exhibit an asymptomatic carrier state similar to bacterial commensalism. It remains unclear if the lack of destructive inflammation merely reflects low virulence or if carrier strains actively inhibit disease-associated responses in the host. Here, we identify a new mechanism of bacterial adaptation through broad suppression of RNA polymerase IIdependent (Pol IIdependent) host gene expression. Over 60% of all genes were suppressed 24 hours after human inoculation with the prototype asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) strain E. coli 83972, and inhibition was verified by infection of human cells. Specific repressors and activators of Pol IIdependent transcription were modified, Pol II phosphorylation was inhibited, and pathogen-specific signaling was suppressed in cell lines and inoculated patients. An increased frequency of strains inhibiting Pol II was epidemiologically verified in ABU and fecal strains compared with acute pyelonephritis, and a Pol II antagonist suppressed the disease-associated host response. These results suggest that by manipulating host gene expression, ABU strains promote tissue integrity while inhibiting pathology. Such bacterial modulation of host gene expression may be essential to sustain asymptomatic bacterial carriage by ensuring that potentially destructive immune activation will not occur.",23728172
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Candida albicans commensalism and pathogenicity are intertwined traits directed by a tightly knit transcriptional regulatory circuit.,"Systemic, life-threatening infections in humans are often caused by bacterial or fungal species that normally inhabit a different locale in our body, particularly mucosal surfaces. A hallmark of these opportunistic pathogens, therefore, is their ability to thrive in disparate niches within the host. In this work, we investigate the transcriptional circuitry and gene repertoire that enable the human opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans to proliferate in two different niches. By screening a library of transcription regulator deletion strains in mouse models of intestinal colonization and systemic infection, we identified eight transcription regulators that play roles in at least one of these models. Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, we uncovered a network comprising 800 target genes and a tightly knit transcriptional regulatory circuit at its core. The network is enriched with genes upregulated in C. albicans cells growing in the host. Our findings indicate that many aspects of commensalism and pathogenicity are intertwined and that the ability of this microorganism to colonize multiple niches relies on a large, integrated circuit.",23526879
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Carbon catabolite control in Candida albicans: new wrinkles in metabolism.,"Most microorganisms maintain strict control of nutrient assimilation pathways to ensure that they preferentially use compounds that generate the most energy or are most efficiently catabolized. In doing so, they avoid potentially inefficient conflicts between parallel catabolic and metabolic pathways. The regulation of carbon source utilization in a wide array of bacterial and fungal species involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, and while the details can vary significantly, carbon catabolite control is widely conserved. In many fungi, the posttranslational aspect (carbon catabolite inactivation [CCI]) involves the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of catabolic enzymes for poor carbon sources when a preferred one (glucose) becomes available. A recent article presents evidence for a surprising exception to CCI in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, an organism that makes use of gluconeogenic carbon sources during infection (D. Sandai, Z. Yin, L. Selway, D. Stead, J. Walker, M. D. Leach, I. Bohovych, I. V. Ene, S. Kastora, S. Budge, C. A. Munro, F. C. Odds, N. A. Gow, and A. J. Brown, mBio 3[6]:e00495-12). In vitro, addition of glucose to cells grown in a poor carbon source rapidly represses transcripts encoding gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1p) and isocitrate lyase (Icl1p), in both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yet, uniquely, the C. albicans proteins persist, permitting parallel assimilation of multiple carbon sources, likely because they lack consensus ubiquitination sites found in the yeast homologs. Indeed, the yeast proteins are rapidly degraded when expressed in C. albicans, indicating a conservation of the machinery needed for CCI. How this surprising metabolic twist contributes to fungal commensalism or pathogenesis remains an open question.",23386434
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",E. coli as an all-rounder: the thin line between commensalism and pathogenicity.,"Escherichia coli is a paradigm for a versatile bacterial species which comprises harmless commensal as well as different pathogenic variants with the ability to either cause intestinal or extraintestinal diseases in humans and many animal hosts. Because of this broad spectrum of lifestyles and phenotypes, E. coli is a well-suited model organism to study bacterial evolution and adaptation to different growth conditions and niches. The geno- and phenotypic diversity, however, also hampers risk assessment and strain typing. A marked genome plasticity is the key to the great variability seen in this species. Acquisition of genetic information by horizontal gene transfer, gene loss as well as other genomic modifications, like DNA rearrangements and point mutations, can constantly alter the genome content and thus the fitness and competitiveness of individual variants in certain niches. Specific gene subsets and traits have been correlated with an increased potential of E. coli strains to cause intestinal or extraintestinal disease. Intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains can be reliably discriminated from non-pathogenic, commensal, or from extraintestinal E. coli pathogens based on genome content and phenotypic traits. An unambiguous distinction of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli and commensals is, nevertheless, not so easy, as strains with the ability to cause extraintestinal infection are facultative pathogens and belong to the normal flora of many healthy individuals. Here, we compare insights into phylogeny, geno-, and phenotypic traits of commensal and pathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that the borderline between extraintestinal virulence and intestinal fitness can be blurred as improved adaptability and competitiveness may promote intestinal colonization as well as extraintestinal infection by E. coli.",23340801
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",EptC of Campylobacter jejuni mediates phenotypes involved in host interactions and virulence.,"Campylobacter jejuni is a natural commensal of the avian intestinal tract. However, the bacterium is also the leading cause of acute bacterial diarrhea worldwide and is implicated in development of Guillain-Barr syndrome. Like many bacterial pathogens, C. jejuni assembles complex surface structures that interface with the surrounding environment and are involved in pathogenesis. Recent work in C. jejuni identified a gene encoding a novel phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase, EptC (Cj0256), that plays a promiscuous role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, FlgG; the lipid A domain of lipooligosaccharide (LOS); and several N-linked glycans. In this work, we report that EptC catalyzes the addition of pEtN to the first heptose sugar of the inner core oligosaccharide of LOS, a fourth enzymatic target. We also examine the role pEtN modification plays in circumventing detection and/or killing by host defenses. Specifically, we show that modification of C. jejuni lipid A with pEtN results in increased recognition by the human Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (hTLR4-MD2) complex, along with providing resistance to relevant mammalian and avian antimicrobial peptides (i.e., defensins). We also confirm the inability of aberrant forms of LOS to activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Most exciting, we demonstrate that strains lacking eptC show decreased commensal colonization of chick ceca and reduced colonization of BALB/cByJ mice compared to wild-type strains. Our results indicate that modification of surface structures with pEtN by EptC is key to its ability to promote commensalism in an avian host and to survive in the mammalian gastrointestinal environment.",23184526
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",CsrRS and environmental pH regulate group B streptococcus adherence to human epithelial cells and extracellular matrix.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus or GBS) is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal and genital tracts and an important cause of invasive infections in newborn infants and in adults with predisposing chronic conditions or advanced age. Attachment to epithelial surfaces at mucosal sites is a critical step in the successful colonization of a human host, and regulation of this process is likely to play an important role in both commensalism and dissemination to cause invasive disease. We found that inactivation of the CsrRS (or CovRS) two-component system increased GBS adherence to epithelial cells derived from human vaginal, cervical, and respiratory epithelium, as well as increasing adherence to extracellular matrix proteins and increasing biofilm formation on polystyrene. Neutral (as opposed to acidic) pH enhanced GBS binding to vaginal epithelial cells and to fibrinogen and fibronectin, effects that were partially dependent on CsrRS. The regulatory effects of CsrRS and environmental pH on bacterial adherence correlated with their effects on the expression of multiple surface adhesins, as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We conclude that GBS adherence to epithelial and abiotic surfaces is regulated by the CsrRS two-component system and by environmental pH through their regulatory effects on the expression of bacterial surface adhesins. Dynamic regulation of GBS adherence enhances the organism's adaptability to survival in multiple niches in the human host.",22949550

However, in order for the cells to robustly perform complex or multiple tasks, co-operation between them may be necessary. Therefore, various synthetic biological systems whose functionality requires cell-cell communication are being designed. These systems, microbial consortia, are composed of engineered cells and exhibit a wide range of behaviors. These include yeast cells whose growth is dependent on one another, or bacteria that kill or rescue each other, synchronize, behave as predator-prey ecosystems or invade cancer cells. In this paper, we study a synthetic ecosystem comprising of bacteria and yeast that communicate with and benefit from each other using small diffusible molecules. We explore the behavior of this heterogeneous microbial consortium, composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cells, using stochastic modeling. The stochastic model captures the relevant intra-cellular and inter-cellular interactions taking place in and between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Integration of well-characterized molecular regulatory elements into these two microbes allows for communication through quorum sensing. A gene controlling growth in yeast is induced by bacteria via chemical signals and vice versa. Interesting dynamics that are common in natural ecosystems, such as obligatory and facultative mutualism, extinction, commensalism and predator-prey like dynamics are observed. We investigate and report on the conditions under which the two species can successfully communicate and rescue each other. This study explores the various behaviors exhibited by the cohabitation of engineered yeast and bacterial cells. The way that the model is built allows for studying the dynamics of any system consisting of two species communicating with one another via chemical signals. Therefore, key information acquired by our model may potentially drive the experimental design of various synthetic heterogeneous ecosystems.",22672814

Total RNA was isolated from nasal carriers, abscesses and cystic fibrosis patients (20 subjects per condition). The expression levels of the sRNAs were measured in the clinical samples and compared with those of the corresponding strains grown in vitro. Five sRNAs were encoded and expressed in all clinical strains in vitro. In vivo, the global expression of the five sRNAs was extremely variable in the abscessed patients, more homogeneous in the cystic fibrosis patients, and highly uniform in the nasal carrier samples. The expression levels of the sRNAs in vivo resembled those obtained at exponential phase or late exponential phase of growth in vitro, for three and one sRNA respectively; while for one sRNA, the expression was always higher in vivo as compared to in vitro growth. The in vitro conditions do not uniformly mimic the in vivo conditions for sRNA expression.

Additionally, the flagellar type III secretion system has been reported to secrete proteins such as CiaI that influence invasion of human intestinal cells and possibly pathogenesis. The flagellar regulatory system ultimately influences (28) activity required for expression of the FlaA major flagellin and other flagellar filament proteins. In this work, we discovered that transcription of ciaI and four genes we propose annotating as feds (for flagellar coexpressed determinants) is dependent upon (28) , but these genes are not required for motility. Instead, the Feds and CiaI are involved in commensal colonization of chicks, with FedA additionally involved in promoting invasion of human intestinal cells. We also discovered that the major flagellin influences production, stability or secretion of (28) -dependent proteins. Specific transcriptional and translational mechanisms affecting CiaI were identified and domains of CiaI were analysed for importance in commensalism or invasion.

AS1. H-NMR spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography and gene expression analyses showed that salicylate is a major secreted metabolic intermediate during naphthalene degradation by strain AS1 and that, in turn, it supports the growth of strain DR1. Interspecies biofilm formation, monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy and microtiter assays, demonstrated that biofilm formation by strain AS1 increased dramatically in the presence of strain DR1 because of the exopolysaccharides generated by the latter. Furthermore, the metabolic commensal interaction of the two strains altered the initial attachment behavior of strain DR1 during biofilm formation. When this strain was cultivated alone under naphthalene-amended conditions, the cells immediately attached to the surface, probably due to the absence of usable substrates, whereas similar behavior was not observed in the mixed culture. This interspecies cell-cell interaction became more complex due to quenching of the quorum-sensing signal of strain DR1 by strain AS1.

Differences to yeast include an extended repertoire of adhesive genes, and high drug, starvation and stress resistance. These properties largely do not originate from novel virulence genes but rather from adaptations of the transcriptional wiring.

The patients carry >10(5) CFU/ml for extended periods of time and rarely develop symptoms. Contrasting the properties of ABU strains to those of uropathogenic isolates causing symptomatic infection is therefore highly relevant to understand mechanisms of bacterial adaptation. The prototype ABU strain Escherichia coli 83972 has a smaller genome than uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains with deletions or point mutations in several virulence genes, suggesting that ABU strains undergo a programmed reductive evolution within human hosts. This study addressed if these observations can be generalized. Strains causing ABU in outpatients or hospitalized patients after catheterization or other invasive procedures were compared to commensal E. coli isolates from the intestinal flora of healthy individuals. Notably, clonal complex 73 (CC73) was a prominent phylogenetic lineage dominated by ABU isolates. ABU isolates from outpatients and hospitalized patients had a similar overall virulence gene repertoire, which distinguished them from many commensals, but typical UPEC virulence genes were less frequently attenuated in hospital strains than in outpatient strains or commensals. The decreased virulence potential of outpatient ABU isolates relative to that of ABU strains from hospitalized patients supports the hypothesis that loss of expression or decay of virulence genes facilitates long-term carriage and adaptation to host environments.",22104113

Maintenance of intracellular homeostasis of metal ions is crucial for survival of these bacteria. In particular Zn(2+), Mn(2+) and Cu(2+) are very important metal ions as they are co-factors of many enzymes, are involved in oxidative stress defense and have a role in the immune system of the host. Their concentrations inside the human body vary hugely, which makes it imperative for Enterococcus to fine-tune metal ion homeostasis in order to survive inside the host and colonize it. Little is known about metal regulation in Enterococcus faecalis. Here we present the first genome-wide description of gene expression of E. faecalis V583 growing in the presence of high concentrations of zinc, manganese or copper ions. The DNA microarray experiments revealed that mostly transporters are involved in the responses of E. faecalis to prolonged exposure to high metal concentrations although genes involved in cellular processes, in energy and amino acid metabolisms and genes related to the cell envelope also seem to play important roles.",22053193

These zoonotic infections result in significant amounts of C. jejuni present in the food supply to contribute to disease in humans. We previously found that a transposon insertion in Cjj81176_1038, encoding a homolog of the Escherichia coli LivJ periplasmic binding protein of the leucine, isoleucine, and valine (LIV) branched-chain amino acid transport system, reduced the commensal colonization capacity of C. jejuni 81-176 in chicks. Cjj81176_1038 is the first gene of a six-gene locus that encodes homologous components of the E. coli LIV system. By analyzing mutants with in-frame deletions of individual genes or pairs of genes, we found that this system constitutes a LIV transport system in C. jejuni responsible for a high level of leucine acquisition and, to a lesser extent, isoleucine and valine acquisition. Despite each LIV protein being required for branched-chain amino acid transport, only the LivJ and LivK periplasmic binding proteins were required for wild-type levels of commensal colonization of chicks. All LIV permease and ATPase components were dispensable for in vivo growth. These results suggest that the biological functions of LivJ and LivK for colonization are more complex than previously hypothesized and extend beyond a role for binding and acquiring branched-chain amino acids during commensalism. In contrast to other studies indicating a requirement and utilization of other specific amino acids for colonization, acquisition of branched-chain amino acids does not appear to be a determinant for C. jejuni during commensalism.",21949065

We report the evolution ofa transcription circuit in C.albicans that controls iron uptake and determines its fitness in both niches. Our analysis of DNA-binding proteins that regulate iron uptake by this organism suggests the evolutionary intercalation of a transcriptional activator called Sef1 between two broadly conserved iron-responsive transcriptional repressors, Sfu1 and Hap43. Sef1 activates iron-uptake genes and promotes virulence in a mouse model of bloodstream infection, whereas Sfu1 represses iron-uptake genes and is dispensable for virulence but promotes gastrointestinal commensalism. Thus, C.albicans can alternate between genetic programs conferring resistance to iron depletion in the bloodstream versus iron toxicity in the gut, and this may represent a fundamental attribute of gastrointestinal commensal-pathogens.",21843869

A polysaccharide was extracted from sucrose-containing liquid cultures of strain 100-23. Chemical analysis showed that this exopolysaccharide was a levan (-2, 6-linked fructan). Mutation of the fructosyl transferase (ftf) gene resulted in loss of exopolysaccharide production. The ftf mutant was able to colonise the murine gastrointestinal tract in the absence of competition, but colonisation was impaired in competition with the wild type. Biofilm formation by the mutant on the forestomach epithelial surface was not impaired and the matrix between cells was indistinguishable from that of the wild type in electron micrographs. Colonisation of the mouse gut by the wild-type strain led to increased proportions of regulatory T cells (Foxp3+) in the spleen, whereas colonisation by the ftf mutant did not. Survival of the mutant in sucrose-containing medium was markedly reduced relative to the wild type. Comparison of the genomic ftf loci of strain 100-23 with other L. reuteri strains suggested that the ftf gene was acquired by lateral gene transfer early in the evolution of the species and subsequently diversified at accelerated rates. Levan production by L. reuteri 100-23 may represent a function acquired by the bacterial species for life in moderate to high-sucrose extra-gastrointestinal environments that has subsequently been diverted to novel uses, including immunomodulation, that aid in colonisation of the murine gut.",21248858
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Core and panmetabolism in Escherichia coli.,"Escherichia coli exhibits a wide range of lifestyles encompassing commensalism and various pathogenic behaviors which its highly dynamic genome contributes to develop. How environmental and host factors shape the genetic structure of E. coli strains remains, however, largely unknown. Following a previous study of E. coli genomic diversity, we investigated its diversity at the metabolic level by building and analyzing the genome-scale metabolic networks of 29 E. coli strains (8 commensal and 21 pathogenic strains, including 6 Shigella strains). Using a tailor-made reconstruction strategy, we significantly improved the completeness and accuracy of the metabolic networks over default automatic reconstruction processes. Among the 1,545 reactions forming E. coli panmetabolism, 885 reactions were common to all strains. This high proportion of core reactions (57%) was found to be in sharp contrast to the low proportion (13%) of core genes in the E. coli pangenome, suggesting less diversity of metabolic functions compared to that of all gene functions. Core reactions were significantly overrepresented among biosynthetic reactions compared to the more variable degradation processes. Differences between metabolic networks were found to follow E. coli phylogeny rather than pathogenic phenotypes, except for Shigella networks, which were significantly more distant from the others. This suggests that most metabolic changes in non-Shigella strains were not driven by their pathogenic phenotypes.

Here we provide the first, genome-wide example of a single bacterial strain's evolution in different deliberately colonized patients and the surprising insight that hosts appear to personalize their microflora. By first obtaining the complete genome sequence of the prototype asymptomatic bacteriuria strain E. coli 83972 and then resequencing its descendants after therapeutic bladder colonization of different patients, we identified 34 mutations, which affected metabolic and virulence-related genes. Further transcriptome and proteome analysis proved that these genome changes altered bacterial gene expression resulting in unique adaptation patterns in each patient. Our results provide evidence that, in addition to stochastic events, adaptive bacterial evolution is driven by individual host environments. Ongoing loss of gene function supports the hypothesis that evolution towards commensalism rather than virulence is favored during asymptomatic bladder colonization.",20865122
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",A systems biology approach to the mutual interaction between yeast and the immune system.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are capable of sensing fungi and then to initiate an appropriate defense against the invading microbe. We studied interactions between host and microorganism by analyzing the transcriptional response of DCs stimulated by the harmless Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of this phagocytosed fungus. Pathway analyses provided insight into the mutual interactions. Of particular interest was the responses elicited by the DC in the fungus, including downregulation of the carbon-compound metabolism, and upregulation of lipid, fatty acid, glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles. This indicates that the yeast shifts to a starvation mode and induces morphogenetic and autophagic pathways as well as those associated with reshaping cell wall composition, to resist the immune clearance. This yeast response is independent of the presence of virulence traits as the same transcriptional cell reprogramming has also been observed in potentially pathogenic C. albicans hyphae phagocytosed by macrophages. When comparing our results with the previous findings, it appears that the yeast dimorphic switch is only one of the components of the evolutionarily conserved panels of survival strategies elicited by phagocytosis. In conclusion, a systems biology approach, which combines genomics and pathway analyses, provides a powerful strategy to further our understanding of complex host-pathogen interactions and may ultimately define the distinguishing features of pathogenicity and commensalism.",20646781
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Success through diversity - how Staphylococcus epidermidis establishes as a nosocomial pathogen.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis normally is a commensal inhabitant of the healthy human skin and mucosa, but also a common nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Living at the edge between commensalism and pathogenicity, S. epidermidis has developed interesting strategies to conquer the hospital environment as a novel ecological niche and to transform into a notorious pathogen. Recent progress in genome analysis and molecular epidemiology gave interesting insights into the enormous flexibility by which these bacteria generate continuously novel phenotypic and genotypic variants. Recent multilocus sequence typing studies identified S. epidermidis as a highly diverse species that evolves mainly by recombination and acquires readily mobile genetic elements. With respect to healthcare-associated isolates, a limited number of epidemic clonal lineages were found to have emerged and established in hospital settings worldwide. These isolates are characterised by the carriage of various SCCmec gene cassettes, conferring methicillin resistance, and by a striking ability to form biofilms on medical devices. Moreover, nosocomial S. epidermidis strains typically harbour multiple copies of the insertion sequence element IS256 in their genomes. Nosocomial S. epidermidis strains vary virulence- and resistance-associated gene expression in the course of an infection to a remarkably high degree. Heterogenous gene expression in S. epidermidis is achieved, on the one hand, by complex regulatory pathways. On the other hand, it is associated with genetic mechanisms that were found to be mediated by the action of the IS256 element which obviously represents an important driving force for the flexibility of the S. epidermidis genome. The data accumulated so far suggest that recombination along with the frequent acquisition of mobile genetic elements are crucial factors for the success of S. epidermidis as a nosocomial pathogen.",20451447
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Virulent clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae: identification and evolutionary scenario based on genomic and phenotypic characterization.,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is found in the environment and as a harmless commensal, but is also a frequent nosocomial pathogen (causing urinary, respiratory and blood infections) and the agent of specific human infections including Friedlnder's pneumonia, rhinoscleroma and the emerging disease pyogenic liver abscess (PLA). The identification and precise definition of virulent clones, i.e. groups of strains with a single ancestor that are associated with particular infections, is critical to understand the evolution of pathogenicity from commensalism and for a better control of infections. We analyzed 235 K. pneumoniae isolates of diverse environmental and clinical origins by multilocus sequence typing, virulence gene content, biochemical and capsular profiling and virulence to mice. Phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes clearly defined clones that differ sharply by their clinical source and biological features. First, two clones comprising isolates of capsular type K1, clone CC23(K1) and clone CC82(K1), were strongly associated with PLA and respiratory infection, respectively. Second, only one of the two major disclosed K2 clones was highly virulent to mice. Third, strains associated with the human infections ozena and rhinoscleroma each corresponded to one monomorphic clone. Therefore, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis should be regarded as virulent clones derived from K. pneumoniae. The lack of strict association of virulent capsular types with clones was explained by horizontal transfer of the cps operon, responsible for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide. Finally, the reduction of metabolic versatility observed in clones Rhinoscleromatis, Ozaenae and CC82(K1) indicates an evolutionary process of specialization to a pathogenic lifestyle. In contrast, clone CC23(K1) remains metabolically versatile, suggesting recent acquisition of invasive potential. In conclusion, our results reveal the existence of important virulent clones associated with specific infections and provide an evolutionary framework for research into the links between clones, virulence and other genomic features in K. pneumoniae.",19319196

One mechanism of genetic variation in this diploid asexual yeast involves loss of heterozygosity (LOH). LOH events occur upon infection and contribute to the acquisition of antifungal resistance in patients. In contrast, little is known about the nature and extent of LOH events during commensalism. Using a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism typing, positional transcript profiling and karyotyping, we have characterized related C. albicans commensal isolates that differ by LOH events. Most of these LOH events encompassed the entirety of the chromosome or a large region extending to the telomere, suggesting chromosome loss or mitotic recombination/break-induced replication events, respectively. They were frequently accompanied by karyotype alterations such as chromosome length polymorphism and copy number variations at other chromosomes.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",In vivo expression technology and signature-tagged mutagenesis screens for identifying mechanisms of survival of zoonotic foodborne pathogens.,"High-throughput genetic screens provide great insights into the biochemistry and molecular biology of how bacteria sense, respond to, and propagate within their environments. Genomics era techniques such as microarrays and proteomics have great potential to increase our understanding of how foodborne pathogens grow and survive within animal and human hosts, in the environment and foods, and during thermal and nonthermal inactivation protocols. While these techniques are incredibly useful for studying gene expression in simplified in vitro conditions, it is much more challenging to pursue similar studies within more complex experimental models such as in vivo, within the food matrix, or within heterogeneous microbial populations. Techniques such as in vivo expression technology (IVET) and signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) provide alternatives for studying bacterial gene expression and growth requirements within these settings. These techniques are used extensively by the medical, veterinary, and plant research communities for identifying genes promoting the colonization and disease process, factors mediating commensalism between bacteria and their host, and genes that promote survival of environmental bacteria within natural settings. Research into the transmission and survival of foodborne pathogens from farm-to-fork would likely benefit from these techniques, however there are few reports describing their use for such purposes. This review will briefly cover the methods of IVET and STM, discuss how these techniques improved our understanding of the interactions between zoonotic foodborne pathogens and their animal hosts, and ask whether these techniques could be further exploited to better understand the survival of foodborne pathogens within the environment, within food matrices, and during inactivation protocols.",18673072

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Regulation of surface architecture by symbiotic bacteria mediates host colonization.,"Microbes occupy countless ecological niches in nature. Sometimes these environments may be on or within another organism, as is the case in both microbial infections and symbiosis of mammals. Unlike pathogens that establish opportunistic infections, hundreds of human commensal bacterial species establish a lifelong cohabitation with their hosts. Although many virulence factors of infectious bacteria have been described, the molecular mechanisms used during beneficial host-symbiont colonization remain almost entirely unknown. The novel identification of multiple surface polysaccharides in the important human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis raised the critical question of how these molecules contribute to commensalism. To understand the function of the bacterial capsule during symbiotic colonization of mammals, we generated B. fragilis strains deleted in the global regulator of polysaccharide expression and isolated mutants with defects in capsule expression. Surprisingly, attempts to completely eliminate capsule production are not tolerated by the microorganism, which displays growth deficits and subsequent reversion to express capsular polysaccharides. We identify an alternative pathway by which B. fragilis is able to reestablish capsule production and modulate expression of surface structures. Most importantly, mutants expressing single, defined surface polysaccharides are defective for intestinal colonization compared with bacteria expressing a complete polysaccharide repertoire. Restoring the expression of multiple capsular polysaccharides rescues the inability of mutants to compete for commensalism. These findings suggest a model whereby display of multiple capsular polysaccharides provides essential functions for bacterial colonization during host-symbiont mutualism.",18319345
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Innate immune homeostasis by the homeobox gene caudal and commensal-gut mutualism in Drosophila.,"Although commensalism with gut microbiota exists in all metazoans, the host factors that maintain this homeostatic relationship remain largely unknown. We show that the intestinal homeobox gene Caudal regulates the commensal-gut mutualism by repressing nuclear factor kappa B-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes. Inhibition of Caudal expression in flies via RNA interference led to overexpression of antimicrobial peptides, which in turn altered the commensal population within the intestine. In particular, the dominance of one gut microbe, Gluconobacter sp. strain EW707, eventually led to gut cell apoptosis and host mortality. However, restoration of a healthy microbiota community and normal host survival in the Caudal-RNAi flies was achieved by reintroduction of the Caudal gene. These results reveal that a specific genetic deficiency within a host can profoundly influence the gut commensal microbial community and host physiology.",18218863
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Self-regulation of Candida albicans population size during GI colonization.,"Interactions between colonizing commensal microorganisms and their hosts play important roles in health and disease. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common component of human intestinal flora. To gain insight into C. albicans colonization, genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied. The EFH1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. Counterintuitively, an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, a model of commensal colonization, whereas an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and of the oral cavity of athymic mice, the latter situation modeling human mucosal candidiasis. When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice, both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, other mutants are attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. Finally, although expression of several genes is dependent on transcription factor Efg1p during laboratory growth, Efg1p-independent expression of these genes was observed during growth within the murine intestinal tract. These results show that expression of EFH1 regulated the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Also, different genes are required in different host niches and the pathway(s) that regulates gene expression during host colonization can differ from well-characterized pathways used during laboratory growth.",18069889
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Molecular basis of commensalism in the urinary tract: low virulence or virulence attenuation?,"In some patients, Escherichia coli strains establish significant bacteriuria without causing symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). These asymptomatic-bacteriuria (ABU) strains have been shown to express fewer virulence factors than the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains that cause severe, symptomatic UTI. Paradoxically, ABU strains carry many typical UPEC virulence genes, and the molecular basis of their low virulence therefore remains unclear. This study examined whether ABU strains might evolve from UPEC by genome loss and virulence gene attenuation. The presence of conserved E. coli K-12 genes was examined using an E. coli K-12 strain MG1655-specific DNA array and the distribution of UPEC virulence-related genes was examined with the E. coli pathoarray. Two groups of strains could be distinguished. Several ABU strains were shown by multilocus sequence typing and by comparative genomic analyses to be related to UPEC but to have smaller genome sizes. There were significant alterations in essential virulence genes, including reductive evolution by point mutations, DNA rearrangements, and deletions. Other strains were unrelated to UPEC and lacked most of the virulence-associated genes. The results suggest that some ABU strains arise from virulent strains by attenuation of virulence genes while others are nonvirulent and resemble commensal strains. We propose that virulence attenuation might constitute a general mechanism for mucosal pathogens to evolve toward commensalism.",18039831
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Extraintestinal virulence is a coincidental by-product of commensalism in B2 phylogenetic group Escherichia coli strains.,"The selective pressures leading to the evolution and maintenance of virulence in the case of facultative pathogens are quite unclear. For example, Escherichia coli, a commensal of the gut of warm-blooded animals and humans, can cause severe extraintestinal diseases, such as septicemia and meningitis, which represent evolutionary dead ends for the pathogen as they are associated to rapid host death and poor interhost transmission. Such infectious process has been linked to the presence of so-called ""virulence genes."" To understand the evolutionary forces that select and maintain these genes, we focused our study on E. coli B2 phylogenetic group strains that encompass both commensal and pathogenic (extra- and intraintestinal) strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), comparative genomic hybridization of the B2 flexible gene pool, and quantification of extraintestinal virulence using a mouse model of septicemia were performed on a panel of 60 B2 strains chosen for their genetic and ecologic diversity. The phylogenetic history of the strains reconstructed from the MLST data indicates the emergence of at least 9 subgroups of strains. A high polymorphism is observed in the B2 flexible gene pool among the strains with a good correlation between the MLST-inferred phylogenetic history of the strains and the presence/absence of specific genomic regions, indicating coevolution between the chromosomal background and the flexible gene pool. Virulence in the mouse model is a highly prevalent and widespread character present in all subgroups except one. Association studies reveal that extraintestinal virulence is a multigenic process with a common set of ""virulence determinants"" encompassing genes involved in transcriptional regulation, iron metabolism, adhesion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, and the recently reported peptide polyketide hybrid synthesis system. Interestingly, these determinants can also be viewed as intestinal colonization and survival factors linked to commensalism as they can increase the fitness of the strains within the normal gut environment. Altogether, these data argue for an ancestral emergence of the extraintestinal virulence character that is a coincidental by-product of commensalism. Furthermore, the phenotypic and genotypic markers identified in this work will allow further epidemiological studies devoted to test the niche specialization hypothesis for the B2 phylogenetic subgroups.",17709333

We identify Toll-like receptors as crucial to the convergence of innate and adaptive responses stimulated by PSA. Optimization of the Th1 cytokine interferon-gamma in PSA-stimulated dendritic cell-CD4+ T cell co-cultures depends on both Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and antigen presentation. Synergy between the innate and adaptive responses was also shown when TLR2-/- mice exhibited impaired intraabdominal abscess formation in response to B. fragilis.

Contact with E. coli expressing this gene cluster causes DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventually to cell death.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",A phase-variable mechanism controlling the Campylobacter jejuni FlgR response regulator influences commensalism.,"Phase variation of genes in bacteria enables phenotypic alteration to modulate interactions within a host as conditions change. To promote commensalism in animals and disease in humans, Campylobacter jejuni produces a flagellar organelle for motility. In addition to tight transcriptional regulation of flagellar genes, C. jejuni also controls flagellar biosynthesis by phase variation. In this study, an unusual phase-variable mechanism controlling production of FlgR, the response regulator of the FlgSR two-component system required for transcription of sigma54-dependent flagellar genes, is identified. Phase variation of FlgR production is due to loss or gain of a nucleotide in homopolymeric adenine or thymine tracts within flgR. This mechanism occurs during commensalism in poultry to alter the colonization capacity of C. jejuni, presumably by influencing the motility phenotype of the bacterium. These findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies C. jejuni employs to achieve commensalism in a natural host. Second, due to the richness of the C. jejuni genome in adenine or thymine residues and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair enzymes, the results from this study may suggest that the C. jejuni genome is more unstable and variable than previously realized. Furthermore, phase variation of flagellar motility by targeting flgR may be a phenomenon specific to C. jejuni that is absent in other Campylobacter species and contribute to reasons why C. jejuni is more frequently found as a commensal organism in poultry and as the cause of disease in humans.",16899076

In this study we were able to identify an orthologue of luxS, required for the synthesis of AI-2 signals, in Streptococcus anginosus. Comparative analyses revealed conserved sequences in the predicted S. anginosus LuxS. Expression of luxS was highest during early exponential growth phase. Compared to other oral streptococci, conditioned media from growth of members of the anginosus group were the most efficient in inducing bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi, indicative of AI-2 signalling. Disruption of luxS in S. anginosus resulted in a mutant deficient in biofilm formation, whereas no effect on planktonic growth rate was observed under various growth conditions. S. anginosus is part of the human flora found in biofilms of the oral cavity, as well as of the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Such habitats harbour large varieties of bacterial species, among which cell-cell communication may play an important role. S. anginosus has also been associated with purulent infections and cancer in the upper digestive tract.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Asymptomatic bacteriuria Escherichia coli strain 83972 carries mutations in the foc locus and is unable to express F1C fimbriae.,"Escherichia coli is the most common organism associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). In contrast to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which causes symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), very little is known about the mechanisms by which these strains colonize the urinary tract. Bacterial adhesion conferred by specific surface-associated adhesins is normally considered as a prerequisite for colonization of the urinary tract. The prototype ABU E. coli strain 83972 was originally isolated from a girl who had carried it asymptomatically for 3 years. This study characterized the molecular status of one of the primary adhesion factors known to be associated with UTI, namely F1C fimbriae, encoded by the foc gene cluster. F1C fimbriae recognize receptors present in the human kidney and bladder. Expression of the foc genes was found to be up-regulated in human urine. It was also shown that although strain 83972 contains a seemingly intact foc gene cluster, F1C fimbriae are not expressed. Sequencing and genetic complementation revealed that the focD gene, encoding a component of the F1C transport and assembly system, was non-functional, explaining the inability of strain 83972 to express this adhesin. The data imply that E. coli 83972 has lost its ability to express this important colonization factor as a result of host-driven evolution. The ancestor of the strain seems to have been a pyelonephritis strain of phylogenetic group B2. Strain 83972 therefore represents an example of bacterial adaptation from pathogenicity to commensalism through virulence factor loss.",16735742
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Conserved genes in a path from commensalism to pathogenicity: comparative phylogenetic profiles of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A and ATCC12228.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis, long regarded as an innocuous commensal bacterium of the human skin, is the most frequent cause of nosocomial infections associated with implanted medical devices. This conditional pathogen provides a model of choice to study genome landmarks correlated with the transition between commensalism and pathogenicity. Traditional investigations stress differences in gene content. We focused on conserved genes that have accumulated small mutation differences during the transition. A comparison of strain ATCC12228, a non-biofilm forming, non-infection associated strain and strain RP62A, a methicillin-resistant biofilm clinical isolate, revealed consistent variation, mostly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in orthologous genes in addition to the previously investigated global changes in gene clusters. This polymorphism, scattered throughout the genome, may reveal genes that contribute to adaptation of the bacteria to different environmental stimuli, allowing them to shift from commensalism to pathogenicity. SNPs were detected in 931 pairs of orthologs with identical gene length, accounting for approximately 45% of the total pairs of orthologs. Assuming that non-synonymous mutations would mark recent evolution, and hence be associated to the onset of the pathogenic process, analysis of ratios of non-synonymous SNPs vs synonymous SNPs suggested hypotheses about possible pathogenicity determinants. The N/S ratios for virulence factors and surface proteins differed significantly from that of average SNPs. Of those gene pairs, 40 showed a disproportionate distribution of dN vs dS. Among those, the presence of the gene encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase suggested a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species. This led us to uncover that the infection associated strain was significantly more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat than the environmental strain. Some 16 genes of the list were of unknown function. We could suggest however that they were likely to belong to surface proteins or considered in priority as important for pathogenicity. Our study proposed a novel approach to identify genes involved in pathogenic processes and provided some insight about the molecular mechanisms leading a commensal inhabitant to become an invasive pathogen.",16684363
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",The role of Candida albicans NOT5 in virulence depends upon diverse host factors in vivo.,"We previously identified Candida albicans Not5p as an immunogenic protein expressed during oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). In this study, we demonstrate that C. albicans NOT5 reverses the growth defects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae not5 mutant strain at 37 degrees C, suggesting that the genes share at least some functional equivalence. We implicate C. albicans NOT5 in the pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis (DC) induced by intravenous infection among neutropenic and nonimmunosuppressed mice, as well as in that of OPC in mice immunosuppressed with corticosteroids. We find no role in virulence, however, among neutropenic and corticosteroid-suppressed mice with DC resulting from gastrointestinal translocation, nor do we implicate the gene in vulvovaginal candidiasis among mice in pseudoestrus. These findings suggest that the role of NOT5 in virulence depends on the specific in vivo environment and is influenced by diverse factors such as tissue site, portal of entry, and the status of host defenses. NOT5 is necessary for normal adherence to colonic and cervical epithelial cells in vitro, demonstrating that such assays cannot fully replicate disease processes in vivo. Lastly, antibody responses against Not5p do not differ in the sera of patients with OPC, patients with DC, and healthy controls, suggesting that the protein is associated with both commensalism and the pathogenesis of disease.",16239513

Both the genomic content and the transcriptome of 10 strains representative of the major E. coli/Shigella phylogenetic groups were evaluated using macroarrays displaying the 4290 K12-MG1655 open reading frames (ORFs). Although Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) are not monophyletic, phylogenetic analysis of the binary coded (presence/absence) gene content data showed that these organisms group together due to similar patterns of undetectable K12-MG1655 genes. The variation in transcript abundance was then analyzed using a core genome of 2880 genes present in all strains, after adjusting RNA hybridization signals for DNA hybridization signals. Nonrandom changes in gene expression during the evolution of the E. coli/Shigella species were evidenced. Phylogenetic analysis of transcriptome data again showed that Shigella and EIEC strains group together in terms of gene expression, and this convergence involved groups of genes displaying biologically coherent patterns of functional divergence. Unlike the other E. coli strains evaluated, Shigella and EIEC are intracellular pathogens, and therefore face similar selective pressures. Thus, within the E. coli/Shigella species, strains exhibiting a particular life style have converged toward a specific gene expression pattern in a subset of genes common to the species, revealing the role of selection in shaping transcriptome polymorphism.",15687289

The 16S ribosomal DNA-based phylogeny suggests that this bacterium belongs to an unknown taxon in the Gram-positive bacterial cluster. Here, we describe the 3.57 Mb genome sequence of S.thermophilum. The genome consists of 3338 protein-coding sequences, out of which 2082 have functional assignments. Despite the high G + C content (68.7%), the genome is closest to that of Firmicutes, a phylum consisting of low G + C Gram-positive bacteria. This provides evidence for the presence of an undefined category in the Gram-positive bacterial group. The presence of both spo and related genes and microscopic observation indicate that S.thermophilum is the first high G + C organism that forms endospores. The S.thermophilum genome is also characterized by the widespread insertion of class C group II introns, which are oriented in the same direction as chromosomal replication. The genome has many membrane transporters, a number of which are involved in the uptake of peptides and amino acids. The genes involved in primary metabolism are largely identified, except those that code several biosynthetic enzymes and carbonic anhydrase. The organism also has a variety of respiratory systems including Nap nitrate reductase, which has been found only in Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, these features suggest that S.thermophilum is adaptable to and thus lives in various environments, such that its growth requirement could be a substance or a physiological condition that is generally available in the natural environment rather than a highly specific substance that is present only in a limited niche.

To gain insight on the genetic level into its properties of colonization and commensalism, this strain's genome structure has been analyzed by three approaches: (i) sequence context screening of tRNA genes as a potential indication of chromosomal integration of horizontally acquired DNA, (ii) sequence analysis of 280 kb of genomic islands (GEIs) coding for important fitness factors, and (iii) comparison of Nissle 1917 genome content with that of other E. coli strains by DNA-DNA hybridization. PCR-based screening of 324 nonpathogenic and pathogenic E. coli isolates of different origins revealed that some chromosomal regions are frequently detectable in nonpathogenic E. coli and also among extraintestinal and intestinal pathogenic strains. Many known fitness factor determinants of strain Nissle 1917 are localized on four GEIs which have been partially sequenced and analyzed. Comparison of these data with the available knowledge of the genome structure of E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 and of uropathogenic E. coli O6 strains CFT073 and 536 revealed structural similarities on the genomic level, especially between the E. coli O6 strains. The lack of defined virulence factors (i.e., alpha-hemolysin, P-fimbrial adhesins, and the semirough lipopolysaccharide phenotype) combined with the expression of fitness factors such as microcins, different iron uptake systems, adhesins, and proteases, which may support its survival and successful colonization of the human gut, most likely contributes to the probiotic character of E. coli strain Nissle 1917.",15292145

To understand how the bacterium promotes commensalism, we used signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis and identified 29 mutants representing 22 different genes of C. jejuni strain 81-176 involved in colonization of the chick gastrointestinal tract. Among the determinants identified were two adjacent genes, one encoding a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP), presumably required for proper chemotaxis to a specific environmental component, and another gene encoding a putative cytochrome c peroxidase that may function to reduce periplasmic hydrogen peroxide stress during in vivo growth. Deletion of either gene resulted in attenuation for growth throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

In the long run, the characterization of such differences might lead to lifestyle prediction or to an evaluation of the pathogenic potential of newly isolated bacteria via the definition of genetic and/or metabolic signatures characteristic for pathogenic or symbiotic organisms. Moreover, it is expected that these investigations will lead to new strategies for the treatment or prevention of bacterial infections, or the avoidance of pathogen transmission.",12622826
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""","Co-regulation of pathogenesis with dimorphism and phenotypic switching in Candida albicans, a commensal and a pathogen.","Candida albicans, a common fungal pathogen of humans, can colonize in many diverse environments of the host and convert between a harmless commensal and a pathogen. Recent advances indicate that C. albicans uses a common set of conserved pathways to regulate dimorphism, mating and phenotypic switching. Major pathways known to regulate dimorphism include a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway through Cph1, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway via Efg1, and Tup1-mediated repression through Rfg1 and Nrg1. The Cph1-mediated MAP kinase pathway is critical for the mating process, while all three pathways are implicated in the regulation of white-opaque switching. All these developmental pathways regulate the expression of hypha-specific and/or phase-specific genes. A high proportion of hypha-specific genes and phase-specific genes encode proteins that contribute directly or indirectly to pathogenesis and virulence of C. albicans. Therefore, virulence genes are co-regulated with cell morphogenesis. This supports a previous notion that the unique aspects of C. albicans commensalism and pathogenesis may lie in the developmental programs of dimorphism and phenotypic switching.",12452278
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Metabolic commensalism and competition in a two-species microbial consortium.,"We analyzed metabolic interactions and the importance of specific structural relationships in a benzyl alcohol-degrading microbial consortium comprising two species, Pseudomonas putida strain R1 and Acinetobacter strain C6, both of which are able to utilize benzyl alcohol as their sole carbon and energy source. The organisms were grown either as surface-attached organisms (biofilms) in flow chambers or as suspended cultures in chemostats. The numbers of CFU of P. putida R1 and Acinetobacter strain C6 were determined in chemostats and from the effluents of the flow chambers. When the two species were grown together in chemostats with limiting concentrations of benzyl alcohol, Acinetobacter strain C6 outnumbered P. putida R1 (500:1), whereas under similar growth conditions in biofilms, P. putida R1 was present in higher numbers than Acinetobacter strain C6 (5:1). In order to explain this difference, investigations of microbial activities and structural relationships were carried out in the biofilms. Insertion into P. putida R1 of a fusion between the growth rate-regulated rRNA promoter rrnBP1 and a gfp gene encoding an unstable variant of the green fluorescent protein made it possible to monitor the physiological activity of P. putida R1 cells at different positions in the biofilms. Combining this with fluorescent in situ hybridization and scanning confocal laser microscopy showed that the two organisms compete or display commensal interactions depending on their relative physical positioning in the biofilm. In the initial phase of biofilm development, the growth activity of P. putida R1 was shown to be higher near microcolonies of Acinetobacter strain C6. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed that in the effluent of the Acinetobacter strain C6 monoculture biofilm the metabolic intermediate benzoate accumulated, whereas in the biculture biofilms this was not the case, suggesting that in these biofilms the excess benzoate produced by Acinetobacter strain C6 leaks into the surrounding environment, from where it is metabolized by P. putida R1. After a few days, Acinetobacter strain C6 colonies were overgrown by P. putida R1 cells and new structures developed, in which microcolonies of Acinetobacter strain C6 cells were established in the upper layer of the biofilm. In this way the two organisms developed structural relationships allowing Acinetobacter strain C6 to be close to the bulk liquid with high concentrations of benzyl alcohol and allowing P. putida R1 to benefit from the benzoate leaking from Acinetobacter strain C6. We conclude that in chemostats, where the organisms cannot establish in fixed positions, the two strains will compete for the primary carbon source, benzyl alcohol, which apparently gives Acinetobacter strain C6 a growth advantage, probably because it converts benzyl alcohol to benzoate with a higher yield per time unit than P. putida R1. In biofilms, however, the organisms establish structured, surface-attached consortia, in which heterogeneous ecological niches develop, and under these conditions competition for the primary carbon source is not the only determinant of biomass and population structure.",11976126
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Extensive surface diversity of a commensal microorganism by multiple DNA inversions.,"The dynamic interactions between a host and its intestinal microflora that lead to commensalism are unclear. Bacteria that colonize the intestinal tract do so despite the development of a specific immune response by the host. The mechanisms used by commensal organisms to circumvent this immune response have yet to be established. Here we demonstrate that the human colonic microorganism, Bacteroides fragilis, is able to modulate its surface antigenicity by producing at least eight distinct capsular polysaccharides-a number greater than any previously reported for a bacterium-and is able to regulate their expression in an on-off manner by the reversible inversion of DNA segments containing the promoters for their expression. This means of generating surface diversity allows the organism to exhibit a wide array of distinct surface polysaccharide combinations, and may have broad implications for how the predominant human colonic microorganisms, the Bacteroides species, maintain an ecological niche in the intestinal tract.",11734857
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",The versatility of Helicobacter pylori in the adaptation to the human stomach.,"A growing body of data indicates that H. pylori colonization of human is ancient, which is consistent with its high prevalence, chronicity of carriage, and generally low level of disease, which, when it occurs has only marginal or no effects on host reproductive capacity. All of these phenomena are markers for a relatively benign co-existence, which may include all of the entire spectrum of interactions from parasitism, through commensalism, to symbiosis. Recent studies suggest the emergence of ""quasispecies"" during prolonged colonization, and the presence of multiple strains colonizing individual hosts. Such observations suggest that concepts of competition between strains and mutualism will be important in understanding the ecology of colonization and its effects on hosts. The presence of particular pathologies in the host may in part be a function of the characteristics of the bacterial population present. At a genomic level, H. pylori appears to adapt to changing conditions by point mutation, genomic rearrangement, and horizontal gene transfer, the latter is favored by its natural competence. The ability of H. pylori to alter phenotypic properties including superficial Lewis antigen expression and secretion of proinflammatory molecules is evidence of its sensitivity to environmental signals from the host. In such a universe, disease outcomes such as ulceration or neoplasia may be considered as accidents secondary to microbial persistence.",9376613

Human mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)GCU, a tRNA that , a tRNA that shows several structural deviations from ""classical"" as well as mitochondrial tRNAs, the most prominent of which is the lack of a D domain, is processed at its 5' end via a novel, ""non-RNase P"" pathway. 5' end maturation of tRNA(Ser(AGY)GCU is the consequence of 3' end processing of the abutting tRNA(His), precisely flanking the tRNA(Ser(AGY)GCU gene at its 5' end. Deletion of this adjoining tRNA structure abolishes efficient 5' end maturation of tRNA(Ser(AGY)GCU in vitro, suggesting that the human mitochondrial tRNA(SeR(AGY)GCU employs a 5'abutting tRNA as a processing signal for 5' end maturation in a kind of molecular commensalism.",9034356
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Switch of phenotype as an escape mechanism of the intruder.,"Phenotypic switching in Candida albicans is a reversible, high-frequency phenomenon that is readily detectable in a fungal population as changes in cell or colony morphology. Some putative attributes of virulence in C. albicans, including expression of cell wall glycoproteins, secretion of proteolytic enzymes and hypha formation have been associated with switching phenomena. C. albicans isolates from active infection tend to show a higher prevalence of phenotypic switching than those associated with commensalism. Moreover, some characteristics of azole resistance in C. albicans are compatible with a switch of phenotype. There is thus a preliminary basis of scientific evidence for a hypothesis that phenotypic switching may indeed serve as an attribute of virulence in at least one pathogenic fungus, facilitating invasion and escape from host defences.",9476497
"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary rate variation within Mus APRT.,"Rodents are thought to have relatively high rates of evolution, twice as fast as the rates for mammals in other orders. However, the uniformly high rates of evolution inferred for the order Rodentia from Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus are not consistently found for other rodent species. Using a maximum likelihood phylogenetic algorithm (DNAML), we show here that Mus spicilegus has a fivefold different rate of evolution in 1100 bp around the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (APRT) since its divergence from a common ancestor with Mus musculus. A greater than threefold difference in rates is also found in a comparison of the number of evolutionary events directly detected from the APRT sequences of these two closely related Mus species. The evolutionary events can be directly detected, since M. spicilegus, M. musculus, and the four rodent outgroup species used to determine the ancestral sequence are so closely related. One of the major differences between M. spicilegus and M. musculus that might affect evolutionary rate is the degree of commensalism with man. The Mus species therefore provide a useful model for testing various hypotheses for the causes of rate variations between genes, and possibly, between lineages.",8890519

The commensal form is characterized by life-history traits probably adaptive to underground man-made environments. This situation has sometimes been considered as an example of recent speciation although the existence of intermediate forms indicates that the balance between gene flow and disruptive selection should first be assessed. The present study was concerned with (1) the determination of biological traits involved in adaptation to commensalism, and (2) the pattern of gene flow within and between ecotypes in a restricted area. It was found that (1) significant differences in biological traits exist between mosquitoes from different habitats, (2) characteristics of the commensal type are not universal in mosquitoes from underground man-made habitats, (3) allozyme markers do not clearly differentiate ecotypes and (4) insecticide resistance genes, which reveal recent migration, occur in each ecotype.

"""commensalism"" AND ""gene""",A lion lentivirus related to feline immunodeficiency virus: epidemiologic and phylogenetic aspects.,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a novel lentivirus that is genetically homologous and functionally analogous to the human AIDS viruses, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2. FIV causes immunosuppression in domestic cats by destroying the CD4 T-lymphocyte subsets in infected hosts. A serological survey of over 400 free-ranging African and Asian lions (Panthera leo) for antibodies to FIV revealed endemic lentivirus prevalence with an incidence of seropositivity as high as 90%. A lion lentivirus (FIV-Ple) was isolated by infection of lion lymphocytes in vitro. Seroconversion was documented in two Serengeti lions, and discordance of mother-cub serological status argues against maternal transmission (in favor of horizontal spread) as a major route of infection among lions. A phylogenetic analysis of cloned FIV-Ple pol gene sequences from 27 lions from four African populations (from the Serengeti reserve, Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Manyara, and Kruger Park) revealed remarkably high intra- and interindividual genetic diversity at the sequence level. Three FIV-Ple phylogenetic clusters or clades were resolved with phenetic, parsimony, and likelihood analytical procedures. The three clades, which occurred not only together in the same population but throughout Africa, were as divergent from each other as were homologous pol sequences of lentivirus isolated from distinct feline species, i.e., puma and domestic cat. The FIV-Ple clades, however, were more closely related to each other than to other feline lentiviruses (monophyletic for lion species), suggesting that the ancestors of FIV-Ple evolved in allopatric (geographically isolated) lion populations that converged recently. To date, there is no clear evidence of FIV-Ple-associated pathology, raising the possibility of a historic genetic accommodation of the lion lentivirus and its host leading to a coevolved host-parasite symbiosis (or commensalism) in the population similar to that hypothesized for endemic simian immunodeficiency virus without pathology in free-ranging African monkey species.",8057472

Here, we demonstrate that HaGLAND5 directly interacts with the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit TaEMB3003 in wheat. TaEMB3003 functions as a susceptibility factor, where its overexpression increases nematode infection by 147.06%, whereas silencing reduces infestation by 53.96%. Mechanistically, TaEMB3003 suppresses PTI (inhibiting <i>NbPti5</i>, <i>NbAcre31</i>, and <i>NbGras2</i> expression), attenuates a flg22-induced ROS burst, and disrupts SA/JA signaling (downregulating <i>TaFAD</i>, <i>TaLOX</i>, <i>TaPAL</i>, and <i>TaPR1</i>). Critically, HaGLAND5 enhances TaEMB3003 acetylation at lysine 39 (K39) and K39A mutation abolishes TaEMB3003-mediated susceptibility.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Evolutionary Diversification and Functions of the Candidate Male Killing Gene wmk.,"Symbiont-mediated male killing (MK) is a mechanism that selectively eliminates male offspring, often by disrupting sex-specific developmental processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the WO-mediated killing gene wmk from Wolbachia prophage WO transgenically reproduces the MK phenotype, yet how the gene evolves and functions across diverse Wolbachia has not been systematically investigated. We analyzed 32 Wolbachia genomes available in the NCBI database to study wmk homologs across different arthropod hosts, reproductive parasitism functions, and Wolbachia supergroups. First, we report at least five distinct wmk phylogenetic clusters (Type I-V), often organized in multigenic dyads or triads. Second, among MK Wolbachia, there is a significantly higher number of wmk genes and diversity in Lepidoptera strains than in Drosophila strains, which exclusively harbor wmk Types I and III. Third, there are three patterns of wmk sequence and genomic organizational changes in Drosophila MK strains that associate with different evolutionary trajectories underpinning the MK phenotype. Fourth, single and combinatory transgenic expression of Types I and III in D. melanogaster uncovers male-biased lethality associated with Type I; however, dual expression of the Types together elicits a major reduction in offspring number. Fifth, wmk genes have low expression level across D. melanogaster developmental stages relative to the cifA and cifB genes, which could explain why cytoplasmic incompatibility is expressed in this system.

Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of <i>PjYUC3</i>, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its infection process remain poorly understood.This study comprehensively investigated <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> infection dynamics in <i>Parascaris equorum</i> eggs using both microscopic and proteomic approaches. Infection was monitored at three distinct stages (early, middle, and late). Microscopic analysis included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and light microscopy (LM) to observe morphological changes. A 4D-DIA-based quantitative proteomics approach was employed to analyze exoproteomic changes, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to validate key genes. Microscopic observations revealed progressive invasion of <i>P. chlamydosporia</i> into nematode eggs, with detailed morphological changes in both fungal structures and eggs, including key stages such as attachment, germination, and egg degradation. Proteomic analysis identified 410 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) across the three stages, with 313 upregulated and 403 downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed DEPs involvement in cellular stress response, proteolysis, metabolic process, and hydrolase activity.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Lifetime expression of egg rejection behaviour in Eurasian magpies is associated with variation in a polymorphic genetic marker.,"Obligate avian brood parasitism is a reproductive strategy in which parasitic birds rely entirely on host species for incubation and chick rearing, reducing host reproductive success. This pressure has led many host species to evolve defenses, particularly the ability to recognize and reject parasitic eggs. However, not all individuals within a host population exhibit this behavior-some accept parasitic eggs, while others reject them. One proposed explanation for this behavioral variation is genetic polymorphism. Previous research on Eurasian magpies (Pica pica) linked egg rejection behavior to a specific microsatellite locus (Ase64), though these studies used genotypes from nestlings, not adult females, who are the ones expressing the behavior. Since egg rejection can change with age, accurately categorizing females as acceptors or rejecters requires repeated observations across their lifespan. This study genotyped adult females whose behavior had been reliably classified over their lifes to test for genetic differences. Results showed significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies at the microsatellite marker MSLp4, which was more common in acceptors. These findings support the hypothesis that a genetic polymorphism contributes to individual variation in egg rejection behavior, a defensive trait that may shift over an individual's lifetime in magpies.",40890360

However, how to regulate IIS transduction is unclear. We speculate that venom-derived IMP-L2 may bind ILPs to inhibit IIS transduction. Consequently, we investigated the regulation of the IIS/TOR pathway by venom-derived IMP-L2. An expression analysis of IIS/TOR pathway genes across various developmental stages of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> demonstrated that this pathway governs the entire developmental process. By examining gene expression before and after parasitism, we determined that <i>S. guani</i> predominantly inhibits TOR pathway signaling in <i>T. molitor</i> post-parasitism.

Here, we expand that work, testing the universality of the patterns observed in Encephalitozoon by investigating and comparing variation in genetic and epigenetic architectures in the high-quality genome assemblies of several major microsporidia clades. Our comparison of nine genomes, including the first genome assemblies of Binucleata daphniae, Gurleya vavrai, and Conglomerata obtusa, and revised, improved assemblies of Glugoides intestinalis, Mitosporidium daphniae, and Ordospora colligata, found limited conservation of genetic and epigenetic architecture across all microsporidia, although many genomic characteristics, such as nucleotide composition and repeat content, were shared between genomes of the same or related clades. For example, rRNA genes were hypermethylated in most species, but their position close to chromosome ends was only found in the Encephalitozoon and its sister clade. GC-content varied widely, linked to genome size, phylogenetic position, and activity of repeat elements. These findings enhance our insight into genome evolution and, consistent with findings from other systems, suggest epigenetic modification as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression and repeat element activity in microsporidia.

We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the complete plastomes of five species of <i>Psittacanthus</i> mistletoes. In addition, publicly available plastomes of 58 species in Loranthaceae were obtained and re-annotated for phylogenetic and comparative analyses. We used a comparative phylogenetic approach to evaluate whether patterns of pseudogenization and gene loss differ among lineages of hemiparasites in Loranthaceae. Gene order was highly conserved, with higher sequence similarity and structural conservation between closely related <i>Psittacanthus</i> species but with considerable plastome size variation (from 121 238 to 125 427bp). The expansion and contraction at the borders of inverted repeats (IRs) and intergenic regions variation greatly contribute to size variations among <i>Psittacanthus</i> plastomes. Phylogenetic analysis of plastomes of 60 species in Loranthaceae including 5 <i>Psittacanthus</i> species of the previously unsampled tribe Psittacantheae was largely congruent with previous phylogenetic studies.

The germination and haustorium formation of P. aegyptiaca are initiated by sensing host plant root exudates. Differences in exudate composition are crucial markers of host resistance. Host plant root exudates significantly influence the development and survival of P. aegyptiaca. To identify root exudates affecting the parasitic weed's growth, we analysed differential metabolites in resistant and susceptible Cucumis melo varieties. Among these, 6-hydroxynicotinic acid was identified as a key compound. Prehaustorium formation, which is induced by haustorium-inducing factors, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), was suppressed in the presence of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid. This compound exerts an inhibitory effect by reducing the expression of genes related to the auxin signalling pathway of P. aegyptiaca, thus weakening parasitism.

However, due to its limited geographic distribution and various abiotic and biotic stresses, saffron is facing significant loss in production and quality. Among biotic stresses, plant parasitic nematodes remain unexplored so far. This study was carried out to investigate pathogenic potential of the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans and the defense gene response of C. sativus. The P. penetrans parasitism resulted in the production of a smaller number of flowers with delayed time required for flower emergence. The nematode parasitism also affected stigma length and weight. Crocin, the major apocarotenoid in saffron, was significantly reduced in flowers arising from nematode parasitized corms. A down-regulation was also observed for some apocarotenoid pathway genes such as phytoene synthase, lycopene -cyclase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 2, the key biosynthetic enzymes for crocin biosynthesis. To understand the molecular interactions between C. sativus and P. penetrans, we performed RNA-seq of control and nematode parasitized corms identifying 1316 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses showed that genes associated with plant signaling, stress response and secondary metabolism were among these DEGs. Phenylpropanoid pathway genes were predominantly expressed in response to the nematode attack. Some genes uniquely associated with plant defense were differentially up-regulated in response to parasitism including NOI1, ILITYHIA, JOKA2, LIFEGUARD 4, and SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",The Root Knot Nematode Meloidogyne graminicola Regulates Rice Potassium Uptake by Targeting OsHAK17 toFacilitate Parasitism in Rice.,"Potassium is an essential element for plant growth and development, and also plays a pivotal role in plant immunity against nematodes. However, it is not clear how plant nematodes manipulate host K<sup>+</sup> signalling pathways to disrupt host immunity and promote their parasitism. Here, we demonstrate the rice K<sup>+</sup> transporter OsHAK17 was targeted by the effector protein MgCOL from Meloidogyne graminicola nematodes. Genetic and phenotypic analyses revealed that knockout of OsHAK17 in rice resulted in decreased resistance to M. graminicola, while overexpression of OsHAK17 in rice enhanced resistance to M. graminicola. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed OsHAK17 interacted with MgCOL. Insitu hybridisation assay showed MgCOL mRNA accumulating in the subventral oesophageal gland of J2 nematodes, while immunolocalisation analysis revealed MgCOL localises to the giant cells during M. graminicola parasitism. Host-induced gene silencing of MgCOL reduced the infection ability of M. graminicola, and over-expressing MgCOL enhanced rice susceptibility to M. graminicola. More importantly, MgCOL-overexpression rice showed decreased K<sup>+</sup> accumulation in roots, which was consistent with it in nematode-infected rice. In conclusion, when M.graminicola nematodes infect rice and secrete MgCOL into rice, MgCOL interacts with OsHAK17, resulting in the change of K<sup>+</sup> uptake and transportation in rice to enhance susceptibility.",40773522
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""","First record of mermithid parasitism in adult biting midges, Culicoides huffi (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), collected from Southern Thailand, with ultrastructural and molecular characterization.","Culicoides biting midges are known vectors of several pathogens, including arboviruses, protozoa, and filarial worms. Additionally, mermithid nematodes have been found to parasitize Culicoides midges, causing pathogenic effects that reduce host fitness and often lead to death. Consequently, mermithids have potential as biocontrol agents to reduce midge populations. However, the biology of these entomopathogenic nematodes infecting Culicoides in Thailand remains unknown. As part of the leishmaniasis surveillance program in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Southern Thailand, we collected Culicoides midges near the residence of a leishmaniasis patient in November 2024. The Culicoides samples were morphologically identified and examined microscopically for parasitic nematodes. Infected midges were dissected to isolate nematodes from each individual. The nematodes were then characterized morphologically using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)and identified molecularly via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the non-filarial hypervariable region I of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU HVR-I) and mermithid small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene, followed by nanopore sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and species delimitation testing. A total of 263 field-caught adult Culicoides midges were collected, with Culicoides huffi of the Calvipalpis group being the most abundant species (n=155, 58.9%). Among these, 35 C. huffi samples, including 4 males, 11 females, and 20 intersex males, were infected with nematodes, resulting in an overall infection rate of 13.3%. The parasitized intersex males, presumably genetically male, exhibited a high degree of feminization in their antennae and wings, which likely enhances female-like behaviors such as detecting and flying toward breeding sites, possibly facilitating parasite transmission and reproductive success. The SEM analysis revealed key morphological features consistent with parasitic nematode larvae of the Mermithidae family, including a long, slender body, a stylet, cephalic papillae, amphids, and a trophosome. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for nucleotide (BLASTn) analysis of non-filarial SSU HVR-I and mermithid-specific SSU rRNA gene sequences identified all nematodes as mermithids, showing 94.2-94.4% similarity to Pheromermis sp. from the hornet and 97.3% similarity to Mermis sp. from Culicoides obsoletus. Phylogenetic analysis and species delimitation suggest that these sequences represent a single putative species distinct from other known mermithids. This study is the first to report mermithid parasitism in Culicoides midges in Thailand, incorporating both ultrastructural and molecular characterization. The novel morphological and molecular insights provided here contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the biology of entomopathogenic nematodes. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of these nematodes for the biological control of Culicoides biting midges.",40722115

In addition, C. serpentis is one of the few Cryptosporidium species that parasitize the stomach of the hosts. To date, the genomic data for gastric Cryptosporidium species are exclusively available for Cryptosporidium andersoni and Cryptosporidium muris, both of which infect warm-blooded hosts. To enhance our understanding of genomic features of C. serpentis, we undertook the Illumina-based whole genome sequencing of four C. serpentis isolates, and generated the first C. serpentis draft genome of 9.11Mb in 292 scaffolds and with an N50 of 102,002bp. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that C. serpentis shares high similarity in genomic characteristics with C. andersoni and C. muris, including genomic identity, gene content, and gene organization. We observed aerobic metabolism and a partial conventional electron transport chain in the three gastric species, which are absent in the intestinal Cryptosporidium species. This divergent metabolism of the three gastric species is likely associated with their parasitism in the stomach of hosts. However, genes involved in purine salvage pathway in C. parvum are lost in C. serpentis as well as in other gastric Cryptosporidium species. These specific gene losses may provide more insights into the anabolic capabilities of Cryptosporidium. A significant reduction in the number of multi-copy genes potentially involving the secretory pathogenesis determinants was observed in C. serpentis, which was also found in the other species with a narrow host range. Compared with the other gastric species, 19 unique genes and 67 divergent orthogroups with low identity were identified in C. serpentis. These genes/orthogroups could provide potential insights into investigating the host preference of C. serpentis and further biological studies should be performed on these genes.",40680879
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Anthropogenic Habitat Loss and Fragmentation May Alter Coevolutionary Progress as Examined in a Brood Parasitism Model.,"Habitat loss and fragmentation (HLF) resulting from anthropogenic disturbances is one of the greatest threats to numerous threatened taxa facing extinction risks. HLF may devastate biodiversity through various pathways such as restricting animal movement and gene flow, reducing opportunities for species to expand or shift their ranges and thus optimizing habitat use, and directly causing population decline and range contraction. Despite these well-documented impacts, the effects of HLF on the coevolutionary processes between coexisting species are rarely examined. In this study, we constructed a cuckoo-host brood parasitism model to explore how HLF of varied degrees may affect the cuckoo-host population dynamics through stochastic and reinforcement simulations. The results, validated with empirical data, revealed that severe HLF significantly increases the cuckoo's extinction risk compared to moderate HLF. Furthermore, severe HLF narrows the range of host rejection rates that allow cuckoo populations to persist under natural conditions. These findings suggest that severe HLF, typically driven by human activities and anthropogenic land use change, may not only directly increase the extinction risk of specific species but also disrupt the coevolutionary interactions, posing more severe ecological consequences than previously anticipated.",40671722
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Laterally acquired chitinase genes in venom facilitate parasitism in egg parasitoid wasps.,"Parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera) play a crucial role in ecosystems and agroforestry pest management as biological control agents. These wasps utilize venom proteins to suppress host immunity and regulate physiology, facilitating offspring development. Although venom functions have been studied in some parasitoids, their roles in egg parasitoids remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing to identify venom proteins in Anastatus japonicus and Anastatus fulloi, two egg parasitoids used in biological control. We discovered a significant expansion of GH19 chitinase in their genomes, with phylogenetic analysis indicating acquisition via lateral gene transfer (LGT) from microsporidian. Functional characterization revealed that four highly expressed GH19 chitinases, Aj13071/Aj13072 in A. japonicus and Af23628/Af23629 in A. fulloi are essential for host egg penetration; silencing these genes increased penetration time and resulted in smaller or incomplete holes. Additionally, silencing Aj13071 and Aj13072 in A. japonicus impaired female fecundity, while Af23628 and Af23629 in A. fulloi affected venom reservoir development and egg load, respectively.

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was utilized to investigate the host metabolic and immune response changes at 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h postparasitization by <i>Phaedrotoma</i> sp.2. We identified 4070 differentially expressed genes, enriched in metabolic (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle, insulin synthesis) and immune (e.g., Toll/Imd pathways) pathways, and RT-qPCR further validated core gene expressions involved in these pathways.

To investigate the functional roles of PIP-binding proteins in the intracellular parasitism and pathogenicity of N. caninum. We identified two novel PIP-binding proteins, NcPX1 and NcPH1, and evaluated their biological functions using CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout strains. The ncpx1 strain displayed reduced replication and invasion, along with altered liposomes accumulation in extracellular parasites and impaired expression of dense granule proteins (GRAs) and microneme proteins (MICs). In vivo assays revealed significantly prolonged survival in mice infected with the ncpx1 strain, underscoring the role of NcPX1 in pathogenicity.

Here, we examined attachment-resistance in adult <i>Drosophila</i> to their naturally co-occurring ectoparasitic mites, <i>Gamasodes pachysetis</i> (Parasitidae). Significant differences in mite attachment duration were documented among 6 species of <i>Drosophila</i>, providing evidence for interspecific differentiation in attachment-resistance. Experiments with <i>D. malerkotliana</i>, a species exhibiting a relatively high rate of mite detachment, revealed that pre-infesting flies significantly reduced mite attachment duration compared to nave controls, indicating a priming effect. In contrast, a reduction in attachment duration was not observed in <i>D. malerkotliana</i> after experimentally wounding the abdominal cuticle. These results suggest that the priming effect is not simply a response to cuticle damage, and that its activation may depend on mite-specific factors. Eight genes were individually tested for their effects on the rate of mite detachment from adult flies by deploying the GAL4-UAS gene knockdown system in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Knockdown of heat shock protein 70Ba (Hsp70Ba) and prophenoloxidase 2 (PPO2), which underlie general stress and melanization responses, respectively, significantly prolonged mite attachment duration, implicating their involvement in host attachment-resistance to mites.

While significant gene losses and relaxed selection have been documented in the nuclear and plastid genomes, how parasitism impacts the molecular evolution and function of mitochondria has remained controversial. One of the main culprits hindering our understanding in this area is the lack of knowledge on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial-targeted genes (N-mt), which encode most mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins. By conducting a comprehensive survey of N-mt genes across angiosperms, we demonstrated significant gene losses and occasional horizontal transfers associated with relaxed selection unique to holoparasitic Orobanchaceae. These putative losses and transfers have the potential to affect mitochondrial function directly and cause cytonuclear incompatibility because of breakdown between co-evolved protein complexes from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Our physiological assessments using high-resolution respirometry revealed that despite genetic alterations, holoparasitic Orobanchaceae maintained OXPHOS capacity but relied more on the fully nuclear-encoded succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Our results document the first example of biased loss of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes without accompanying mitochondrial-encoded gene loss in parasitic plants, expanding on previous studies and elucidating the mechanisms underlying the preservation of OXPHOS function despite genomic reduction.",40625319

The parasitism by root-feeding nematodes is on the negative end of the interaction spectrum, and may be very difficult to control. Biological agents are a promising alternative to the environmentally harmful nematicides; however, their efficiency in natural soil often seems to be low due to their limited establishment and dispersal. Thus, understanding how the introduced biological agents interact with nematodes and the surrounding microbiota is necessary to improve sustainable management of root-feeding nematodes. Here, we conducted two experiments to study the effects of Pseudomonas protegens strain CHA0 (CHA0) on the performance of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. In the first experiment, we compared M. incognita performance in natural and sterilized soil in the presence and absence of CHA0. In the second experiment, we studied the composition of microbes in the rhizosphere and endosphere of tomato plants grown in native soil in response to M. incognita and CHA0. We found that nematode performance, especially nematode reproduction, was significantly increased in native soil amended with CHA0. In addition, we found the highest relative abundance of Pseudomonas in tomato endosphere in response to nematode co-inoculations with CHA0, which suggests that root wounding, caused by nematodes, increased the entrance of inoculated and/or native Pseudomonas spp. As many Pseudomonas spp. are plant growth promoting, this may explain that plant growth was highest in this treatment. Furthermore, the rhizosphere of nematode-inoculated plants was enriched with Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga and Variovorax, which are genera generally associated with nematode-suppressive soils. On the other hand, other known nematode-suppressive genera such as Bacillus, Lysobacter, Devosia and Rhizobium were depleted in plants where nematodes were co-inoculated with CHA0, which may explain the higher nematode performance when plants were co-inoculated with CHA0. Our findings show that the effect of P. protegens strain CHA0 on M. incognita parasitism is influenced by the multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere and endosphere of tomato plants.

Adult females from these two generations are genetically identical, making them an informative model to identify molecular differences between parasitic and free-living lifestyles and understand different reproductive strategies. We investigated the expression of small RNAs (sRNAs) that are either enriched for a 5' monophosphate modification (5'pN) or are 5' modification-independent, across five life cycle stages of the rodent parasite Strongyloides venezuelensis. We identified miRNAs and small-interfering RNAs expressed by S. venezuelensis that are predicted to target and regulate the expression of protein-coding genes and transposable elements (TEs). Three previously unreported classes of sRNA were identified: (1) 25Gs with a putative role in reproduction in adult females, (2) tRNA-derived 24-28 nt sRNAs (tsRNAs) which are predicted to target TEs in free-living females, and (3) 5'pN-enriched 26-29Cs with 5' CGAATCC and 3' TTT motifs expressed in parasitic females.

This study utilized an in vitro C. campestris haustorium induction system to investigate this issue. RNA-sequence analysis revealed a group of differentially expressed genes that responded to the initiation of haustorium formation. Genes associated with light-signaling pathways, including phytochromes (PHYs), phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs), and homeodomain-leucine zipper I/II transcription factors, were specifically up or downregulated in plants exposed to light for 4 h. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two distinct forms of the PHYB gene, CcPHYB1 and CcPHYB2, were present in all sequenced Cuscuta species. CcPHYB2 was not expressed under normal light conditions, but was specifically upregulated under light regimes inducing haustorium formation; by contrast, CcPHYB1 exhibited non-light-dependent expression. Furthermore, the induction of haustorium formation by far-red light was canceled by red light exposure but could be re-activated by subsequent re-exposure to far-red light. The levels of expression of CcPHYB2, CcPIF1, CcPIF4, CcHOMEOBOX FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 3 (CcHAT3), CcHOMEOBOX 2 (CcHB2) and CcHB13 varied under different haustorium-inducing light conditions. Expression of these genes altered significantly upon exposure to blue and far-red light, but these changes were reversed in plants exposed to red light.

In Australia, L. c. dorsalis is predominantly found in rural areas and is the primary causative agent of sheep myiasis (flystrike), while L. c. cuprina is necrophagous and not a significant pest of livestock in the Americas or elsewhere. Here, we present a chromosome-scale genome assembly for L. c. cuprina and an improved assembly for L. c. dorsalis, enabling comparative genomic analysis between these subspecies. While both genomes share a similar gene content, subspecies-specific genes were identified, which may contribute to their divergent ecological roles -necrophagy in L. c. cuprina and parasitism in L. c. dorsalis. Phylogenetic analyses across target genomic regions reaffirm the close relationship between L. c. cuprina and L. c. dorsalis and position L. sericata as their sister species. Gene mutations linked to diazinon resistance were exclusively observed in L. c. dorsalis, whereas malathion resistance was detected in both subspecies. Additionally, we identified genes with accelerated evolutionary rates in each subspecies, which may underlie their distinct feeding behaviours. We also conducted a detailed analysis of chemosensory genes, revealing that L. c. dorsalis possesses slightly larger repertoires of all four chemosensory gene families studied.

Using developmental expression analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical tests, we found that both Hs28B03 and Hs8H07 were expressed and secreted during the early parasitism by Heterodera schachii. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were used to assess the role of Hs28B03 and Hs8H07 in H. schachii parasitism. Yeast two-hybrid was used to identify host targets in Arabidopsis. We identified Hs28B03 and Hs8H07 from H. schachtii, which play a crucial role in promoting nematode infection and parasitism, as well as inhibiting host immune responses. Hs28B03 and Hs8H07 harbor the SKP1/BTB/POZ domain and exhibit the capacity to mimic the host's SKP1 proteins, allowing them to regulate the ubiquitin pathway within the plant. Hs28B03 and Hs8H07 specifically target and degrade the host's AtSRC2 protein, inhibiting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent production of ROS mediated by RBOHF, enhancing Arabidopsis susceptibility to H. schachtii.

Here, we used online-available proteomes covering 25 major taxonomic groups to characterize the Tudor gene family at a holozoan-wide level, confirming the apomorphic metazoan expansion of Piwi-interacting RNA-related Tudor genes. However, we also annotated elements of the Piwi-interacting RNA pathway (Tudor and Piwi genes) in Ichthyosporea species, suggesting that elements of the Piwi-interacting RNA pathway were already present in the holozoan common ancestors. We observed an outstanding variability (34-fold) of Tudor gene number between and within metazoan phyla that could be associated with convergent genomic and phenotypic evolutions: expansions were usually sided by whole-genome duplications and/or life history traits such as parthenogenesis; reductions were mostly associated to overall phenotypic and genomic simplifications, like in almost all considered endoparasites. Lastly, we phylogenetically tested, and mostly (but not completely) confirmed, a previously proposed model for the evolution of the Tudor domain secondary structures.",40489295

Phytohormones, amino acids, and proteins have been suggested as compound types involved in gall formation, and a few specific molecules have been proposed as candidate effector molecules; however, no specific gall-inducing effector molecules have been identified. Hence, in this study, we identified the cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) peptide from horned gall aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis transcripts through in silico screening and the Arabidopsis-based gall-forming assay, a bioassay system for analysing the molecular mechanisms of gall formation. Furthermore, we successfully generated the insect-gall-like structure in Veronica peregrina-the host plant of the gall-forming weevil Gymnaetron miyoshii Miyoshi-without insect parasitism, using three minimal effector elements: the CAP peptide, auxin, and cytokinin. Given the similarity of the gall structure to the native gall, both in gene expression profile and morphology, we experimentally demonstrated that the gall-like structure was artificially generated using effector molecules, the CAP peptide, auxin, and cytokinin.",40488419

The parasite-host relationships are complex and dynamic, and selective pressures exerted by the hosts can lead to local adaptations and changes in the genetic structure of the parasite population. Our aim was to investigate how parasitism on a diverse range of avian hosts with varying ecology and habitat preferences shapes the genetic variation of the parasite. For this purpose, we quantified the genetic structure and differentiation of host-related populations of a common polyxenic avian ectoparasite <i>Ornithomya avicularia</i> (Hippoboscidae, Ornithomyinae), a louse fly species parasitizing various bird species occupying diverse ecological niches. Using 20 polymorphic microsatellite markers, we genotyped louse flies collected from four phylogenetically (passerine and non-passerine) and ecologically (wetland vs. forest) divergent avian hosts caught during autumn migration. Despite the ecological and phylogenetic differences among hosts, the genetic differentiation among louse fly populations was modest, indicating ongoing gene flow. Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis identified two genetic clusters with relatively weak barriers to gene flow, but this clustering reflected neither phylogenetic nor ecological differences between hosts. We suggest that the high dispersal abilities and the specific reproductive strategy of <i>O. avicularia</i> likely contribute to the genetic homogeneity of its populations across ecologically and phylogenetically distant hosts. This study provides novel insights into the population genetics of an understudied ectoparasite, with implications for understanding host-parasite interactions and disease transmission in avian systems.",40487347

Compared to their Poulsonii clade counterparts, we infer that the three Citri clade strains have the following: (1) equal or worse DNA repair abilities; (b) more limited metabolic capacities, which may underlie their comparatively lower titres and transmission efficiency; and (c) similar content of toxin domains, including at least one ribosome-inactivating protein, which is implicated in the Poulsonii-conferred defence against natural enemies. As a byproduct of our phylogenomic analyses and exhaustive search for certain toxin domains in public databases, we document the toxin repertoire in close relatives of <i>Drosophila</i>-associated <i>Spiroplasma</i>, and in a very divergent newly discovered lineage (i.e. 'clade X'). Phylogenies of toxin-encoding genes or domains imply substantial exchanges between closely and distantly related strains.

While the shrinkage of genomes in intracellular symbionts of animals, including parasitic bacteria, has been extensively exami-ned, less is known about symbiotic bacteria associated with single-celled eukaryotes. We herein report the genomes of two novel gammaproteobacterial lineages, RS3 and XS4, identified as putative parasitic endosymbionts of the dinoflagellate Citharistes regius. Phylogenetic ana-lyses suggest that RS3 and XS4 belong to the family Fastidiosibacteraceae within the order Beggiatoales, forming independent lineages therein. The genomes of RS3 and XS4 are 529 and 436 kbp in size, respectively, revealing marked reductions from related bacterial genomes. XS4, which has a very reduced genome with a low GC content, uses a different genetic code, in which UGA assigned tryptophan. The small genomes of RS3 and XS4 encode a limited number of proteins, retaining only approximately 20% of the predicted ancestral proteome. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that RS3 and XS4 are parasitic symbionts that are heavily dependent on their host for essential metabolites. Furthermore, we found that the ancestor of both genomes likely acquired an ADP:ATP antiporter gene via horizontal gene transfer, an event that may have enabled their evolution as energy parasites by facilitating the acquisition of ATP from their host.

A candidate effector, MiMSP8, of Meloidogyne incognita has been shown to localise within the nucleus when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells, but its role is still unknown. We demonstrate that the MiMSP8 protein is expressed in the dorsal gland of M. incognita juveniles and it can also be detected within giant cells induced by nematodes. Silencing of MiMSP8 impairs nematode parasitism while overexpression of MiMSP8 increases susceptibility to nematode infection. MiMSP8 interacts with SlU2AF35, the small subunit of the U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) in tomato. This interaction competes with SlU2AF65 for binding to SlU2AF35, thereby disrupting the formation of heterodimers of the key splicing factor U2AF. Overexpression of MiMSP8 in tomato hairy roots leads to genome-wide alternative splicing changes involved in multiple biological processes. MiMSP8 interferes with the binding between SlU2AF35 and pre-mRNAs of a subset of genes. Silencing SlU2AF35 results in abnormal gene splicing in plants and increases their sensitivity to nematode parasitism. Collectively, our findings reveal that M. incognita deploys a nuclear localised effector to target a key component of the spliceosome and disrupt the splicing of plant pre-mRNA to promote parasitism.",40458975

We investigated the effects of parasitism by the cestode Anomotaenia brevis on colonies of its intermediate host, the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We evaluated changes in worker and queen survival rates and transcriptional activity in the fat body of infected and uninfected workers, as well as in the parasite itself, in relation to infected worker prevalence and colony size. Cestode-infected workers are known to exhibit a significantly extended lifespan compared to uninfected workers. Here, we demonstrate that the survival rates of infected workers, uninfected queens, and uninfected workers decrease with increasing infected worker prevalence and increase with colony size. Transcriptomic analysis revealed stress-related signatures in all workers, regardless of infection status, as infection prevalence increased. Moreover, gene expression patterns, particularly in uninfected workers, were strongly influenced by colony size. The transcriptional activity of the parasitic cestode also shifted with infected worker prevalence, highlighting the complex dynamics of host-parasite interactions. These results demonstrate that parasites in social species impose colony-wide impacts that extend beyond infected individuals, even in the absence of direct cross-nestmate infection risks. Moreover, the consequences of parasitism can be modulated by colony size.",40448622

Effectors secreted by the parasite play an essential role during nematode infection through suppressing plant innate immunity. Here, we identify and characterize a M. incognita effector designated as MiV86, which is secreted into plant cells and positively regulates nematode parasitism. We show that MiV86 interacts with RING finger protein 217 (NbRNF217), an RBR-type E3 ubiquitin ligase of Nicotiana benthamiana, which negatively regulates plant immunity in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that NbRNF217 targets and ubiquitinates the helper nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor protein NRC4, resulting in its relocation and degradation through the 26S proteasome and endosomal/vacuolar pathways. NbRNF217 regulates its homeostasis through self-catalyzed ubiquitination or external ubiquitination modifications, and we show that MiV86 inhibits the ubiquitination of NbRNF217 in planta without affecting its activity, thereby promoting the degradation of NRC4, which also contributes to the resistance of N. benthamiana against M. incognita.

In contrast, race SG4z successfully parasitizes B301, rapidly making vascular connections following attachment, undergoing cotyledon expansion (CE) and completing its lifecycle. Comparative transcriptomics identified a set of differentially expressed transcripts in Striga haustorial secretome during incompatible host-parasite interactions that annotated as candidate avirulence (Avr) factors. We cloned the full-length coding sequence of two candidate genes, SGall_094658.3 (SGCHE) encoding a carbohydrate esterase and SGall_060151.1 (SGFAD) encoding a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding Berberine family protein. Both genes encoded proteins with N-terminal apoplast targeting signals. Full-length SGCHE and SGFAD and truncated versions lacking the apoplast signal peptide (SGCHESP and SGFADSP) were expressed in the roots of B301 composite plants. Functional analysis showed that the transgenic B301 roots expressing SGCHE, SGCHESP, SGFAD, and SGFADSP demonstrated enhanced resistance to SG4z parasitism as indicated by increased levels of HR and reduced levels of parasite CE.

Cuscuta australis parasitism hinders X. spinosum growth and development by absorbing nutrients, leading to reduced reproductive performance. However, which metabolite changes contribute to stunted growth and diminished reproductive performance in X. spinosum? Additionally, what genes regulate these metabolites? These underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. X. spinosum was used to determine the physiological relevance of C. australis parasitism to alleviate host plant growth and explore the molecular mechanism, with a focus on metabolic pathways. The results revealed that C. australis significantly reduced the growth potential of X. spinosum, with a particularly notable decrease in seed quantity, which decreased by 92.07%. C. australis parasitism increased the activities of the peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes in the stems of X. spinosum. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that C. australis influenced lignin synthesis in the stem through the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Concurrently, the majority of differentially expressed genes in the galactose metabolism pathway were upregulated, leading to increased sugar accumulation and disrupted metabolism. Furthermore, all differentially expressed genes in the autophagy-other pathway were upregulated, resulting in excessive autophagy and a significant reduction in the reproductive performance of X. spinosum.

It is yet unknown how this phenotype has evolved and whether it is determined by the same genetic architecture in different species or not. To address these questions, we evaluated key behavioural phenotypes in species with contrasting feeding habits, focusing on female oviposition preferences and larval survival on distinct diets, both critical aspects of their life cycles. These assays allowed us to propose hypotheses of how oviposition and larval behaviours contribute to feeding habits displayed in nature for parasitic and saprophagous species. Additionally, a transcriptome-wide analysis revealed genes and functional pathways potentially linked to parasitic behaviour by comparing gene expression profiles and coding sequence evolution. In the genetic analysis, we identified genes with important functions related to the measured behaviours, revealing that distinct genes may underlie each independent case of parasitism evolution, suggesting a non-parallel evolutionary pathway for this convergent trait.",40323040

Polistes wattii is an Asian wasp, which hibernates in winter and exhibits a biannual nest founding strategy. It is often parasitized by the strepsipteran endoparasite/parasitoid Xenos gadagkari, which changes the morpho-physiology and behavior of their hosts. In this study, we employ 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, using the Oxford Nanopore platform, to study the microbial community of P. wattii and investigate the effects of seasonality, sex, and Xenos parasitism.

This research employs mass spectrometry to analyze the proteomes of infected and uninfected roots from susceptible (Moneymaker) and resistant (LA1792 and L10) tomato lines. Over 2800 high-confidence protein hits were identified, revealing significant differences in abundance between susceptible and resistant lines. Notably, resistant lines exhibited a higher number of newly expressed proteins compared to susceptible lines; however, the proportion of induced and suppressed proteins was strongly genotype-dependent. Gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted that nematode infection in susceptible line significantly regulates many defense-related proteins, particularly those involved in oxidative stress, with a similar number being upregulated and downregulated. Some GO terms enriched among nematode-regulated proteins also indicate the involvement of programmed cell death (PCD)-related processes. The susceptible line exhibited a prevalence of downregulated proteins, among which defense associated GO terms were significantly overrepresented. Four proteins (APY2, NIA2, GABA-T, and AATP1) potentially crucial for nematode parasitism were identified and their <i>Arabidopsis</i> orthologs were studied.

Kudoa iwatai, for example, has lost upwards of two-thirds of genes thought to have been present in its ancestors. However, little is known about myxozoan genome architecture because of a lack of sufficiently contiguous genome assemblies. This work presents two new Kudoa genomes, one of them near-chromosomal, built entirely from low-coverage long reads from infected fish samples. The results illustrate the potential of using unsupervised learning methods to disentangle sequences from different sources, and facilitate producing genomes from undersampled taxa. Extracting distinct components of chromatin interaction networks allows scaffolds from mixed samples to be assigned to their source genomes. Meanwhile, low-dimensional embeddings of read composition permit targeted assembly of potential parasite reads. Despite drastic changes in genome architecture in the lineage leading to Kudoa and considerable sequence divergence between the two genomes, gene order is highly conserved. Although parasitic cnidarians show rapid protein evolution compared with their free-living relatives, there is limited evidence of less efficient selection. While deleterious substitutions may become fixed at a higher rate, large evolutionary distances between species make robustly analyzing patterns of molecular evolution challenging.

Here, we performed a genome-wide association study using 152 tomato accessions and identified <i>SlABCG45</i> as a key gene that mediates host resistance to <i>Phelipanche aegyptiaca</i> by affecting the level of strigolactones (SLs) in root exudates. SLs are synthesized and released by host plants and act as germination stimulants for parasitic weeds. We found that SlABCG45 and its close homolog SlABCG44 were membrane-localized SL transporters with essential roles in exudation of SLs to the rhizosphere, resistance to <i>Phelipanche</i> and <i>Orobanche</i>, and upward transport of SLs from roots to shoots. As a predominant environmental stimulant exacerbates parasitism, phosphorus deficiency dramatically induced <i>SlABCG45</i> expression and weakly induced <i>SlABCG44</i> expression via the transcription factors SlNSP1 and SlNSP2. Knockout of <i>SlABCG45</i> in tomato had little effect on yield traits in a broomrape-free field, but conferred increased resistance to different <i>Phelipanche</i> and <i>Orobanche</i> species, resulting in an 30% yield increase in a <i>Phelipanche</i>-infested field.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Morphological and molecular characterization of Crassicauda anthonyi in Cuvier's beaked whales from the Canary Islands.,"Cuvier's beaked whale (CBW) (Ziphius cavirostris) is a cosmopolitan species known for its remarkable diving capabilities and is widely distributed across most seas and oceans, including the waters surrounding the Canary Islands. This species frequently exhibits a high prevalence of parasitism by the nematode Crassicauda spp., which affects the kidney, urinary tract, and arterial walls via larval migration, and is considered one of the primary natural causes of mortality among CBWs in the Canary archipelago. Despite its significance, molecular identification of this parasite in the Canary Islands has not been systematically conducted until now. To address this gap, 51 CBW's stranded in the Canary Islands between 1999 and 2023 were necropsied, and 11 adult nematodes were collected from the kidneys of 11 CBWs. Morphological identification and molecular analyses targeting the mitochondrial COX1 gene and the ITS-2 region were performed, with phylogenetic relationships within the genus Crassicauda assessed. Adult parasitism was observed in 86% of the examined animals. Morphological examination identified the species as Crassicauda cf. anthonyi, which was corroborated by molecular analyses as Crassicauda anthonyi. Renal nodular lesions associated with parasitism were characterized by granulomatous inflammation of varying severity, with intralesional nematodes, fibrosis, necrosis, and multifocal mineralization. Crassicauda anthonyi demonstrates a high prevalence and host specificity, contributing to significant renal pathology in stranded CBWs. This study provides parasite morphological data and molecular identification of C. anthonyi in the Canary Islands, enhances understanding of its prevalence, and expands both the taxonomy and genetic sequence database for the Crassicauda genus.",40050911

During its interaction with host plants, M. incognita synthesises numerous effectors in oesophageal glands, which are then secreted into plant tissues. Here, we characterised the effector MiISE23 and found that it could suppress plant immune responses. In situ hybridisation showed that MiISE23 was expressed in the subventral glands. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MiISE23 were more susceptible to M. incognita, whereas host-derived RNAi of MiISE23 was found to decrease M. incognita infection in Arabidopsis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that MiISE23 repressed jasmonate (JA) signalling by directly interacting with and suppressing jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile)-induced degradation of jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins by COI1. The expression of MiISE23 in Arabidopsis repressed the expression of JA-responsive genes and reduced the levels of endogenous JA-Ile. AtJAZ6 transgenic lines of Arabidopsis showed increased susceptibility to M. incognita infection. Collectively, our results show that MiISE23 stabilises JAZ proteins and interferes with JA signalling, revealing a novel mechanism utilised by root-knot nematodes to hijack phytohormone signalling and promote parasitism.",40045540
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Striga hermonthica induces lignin deposition at the root tip to facilitate prehaustorium formation and obligate parasitism.,"Striga hermonthica, an obligate parasitic plant that causes severe agricultural damage, recognizes its hosts by sensing haustorium-inducing factors (HIFs). Perception of HIFs induces the rapid transformation of S. hermonthica radicles into prehaustoria, structures that enable host invasion and mature into haustoria. HIFs consist of various aromatic compounds, including quinones, lignin monomers, and flavonoids. However, the downstream molecular pathways that orchestrate these developmental events are largely unknown. Here, we report that S. hermonthica root-tip cells rapidly deposit lignin, a major cell wall component, in response to HIFs. In addition to enhancing lignin levels, HIFs strongly induce genes involved in lignin monomer biosynthesis and polymerization, including several respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) and class III peroxidases. Disruption of lignin monomer biosynthesis compromises prehaustorium formation, whereas HIF-induced class III peroxidases facilitate the process by promoting lignification. Our study demonstrates that cell wall lignification is a converged cellular process downstream of various HIFs that guides root meristematic cells in prehaustorium development.",40033692

However, some populations, from experimental evolution setups and field samplings, are able to overcome these resistances. Herein, a transcriptomics approach was used to disentangle the mechanisms by which G. pallida adapts to the plant resistant factor GpaV<sub>vrn</sub>, and to elucidate the functions involved in this adaptation. Differential gene expression analysis between virulent and avirulent lineages originating from experimental evolution experiments identified candidate genes involved in the adaptation to GpaV<sub>vrn</sub>. GO enrichment analyses showed that virulent lineages up-regulated genes involved in cell wall destruction and stress response compared to avirulent lineages. In virulent lineages, a set of genes was up-regulated later in the parasitism stages and are thus potentially involved in adaptation. These genes encode effectors of the VAP and SPRYSEC families contributing to the suppression of plant immunity. These results will have a major impact on our understanding of the mechanisms by which nematodes adapt to resistant plants, and will contribute to identify effective and sustainable management strategies.",39994529

Host plant resistance is the most plausible approach for minimizing these losses. QTL mapping and early transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes within the QTL regions on chromosome 11 (qMi-C11) and chromosome 14 (qMi-C14). Although these QTL regions have been fine-mapped and candidate genes identified, expression profiling of Meloidogyne-Gossypium interactions across different stages of infection could further refine the list of candidate genes. This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance conferred by qMi-C11 and qMi-C14 against Southern root-knot nematode. Using time-course RNA-seq analyses across nematode developmental phases, we uncovered transcriptomic events-both genome-wide and within QTL intervals-underlying defense responses during compatible interactions (with Cocker 201, a susceptible line) and incompatible interactions (with M-120 RNR, a resistant line). Basal defense responses were observed in both compatible and incompatible interactions, with stronger expression in the incompatible interaction. Nematode-responsive genes associated with defense pathways showed distinct dynamics, characterized by repression during compatible interactions and early induction, greater diversity, and heightened upregulation during incompatible interactions. This study uncovers a broad repertoire of disease resistance and putative resistance genes, as well as pathogenesis-related genes, ligands, and receptors, that are differentially expressed in response to nematode parasitism. Mapping of these genes across the cotton genome identified promising candidates, including Gh_A11G3090 (PUB21) and Gh_A11G2836 (RPPL1) within the chromosome 11 QTL region, andGh_D02G0257 (RLP12) and Gh_D02G0259 (RLP12) within the chromosome 14 QTL region.

Rhizocephalan barnacles usually absorb nutrients from the hostthrough a complex rootlet system (the interna), and also change the morphology, physiology and behavior of their hosts. However, little is known about the transcriptomic landscape, ultrastructural detailsand gene expression of theinterna rootlets in the group. In this study, we investigated the structural and molecular signatures of the interna of P. sinensis by using detailedhistological staining and transcriptomic analyses. The interconnected F-actin nodal network, lipid droplets, and nucleus of interna rootlets were visualized using fluorescence straining. We successfully obtained a clean transcriptome of P. sinensis and conducted functional analyses of interna embedded within host hepatopancreas, claw muscle, and eyestalk. The gene ontology (GO) terms related to translation, metabolic process, biosynthetic process, cellular process were highly expressed in the top 10% transcripts from the interna. The GO category of shared differential expression of genes (DEGs) among internae was related to embryonic development. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and the GO term neurotransmitter transporter activity were identified in the shared DEGs among internae. The interna entangled within host hepatopancreas, eyestalk and claw muscle fibers had similarities and differences in the functional biology. Additionally, the interna specific candidate genes probably involved in host immune, lipid metabolism, molting and growth were identified. Our study demonstrates an in-depth function of interna rootlets of P. sinensis and reveals potential mechanisms of parasite hostcontrol.

This study introduces a highly effective Rhizobium rhizogenes-mediated transformation system for C. campestris using a pBIN plasmid harboring a Yellow Fluorescence Protein reporter gene. We optimized transformation and regeneration by assessing explant type, media composition, and plant growth regulators. Notably, host plant contact was essential for transgenic shoot regeneration. Over 70% transformation efficiency was achieved using cuttings co-incubated with modified Murashige and Skoog medium and 5 mg/L Benzylaminopurine, followed by transfer to tomato hosts.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Phylogenomic resolution of marine to freshwater dinoflagellate transitions.,"Dinoflagellates are an abundant and diverse group of protists that inhabit aquatic environments worldwide. They are characterized by numerous unique cellular and molecular traits, and have adapted to an unusually broad range of life strategies, including phototrophy, heterotrophy, parasitism, and all combinations of these. For most microbial groups, transitions from marine to freshwater environments are relatively rare, as changes in salinity are thought to lead to significant osmotic challenges that are difficult for the cell to overcome. Recent work has shown that dinoflagellates have overcome these challenges relatively often in evolutionary time, but because this is mostly based on single gene trees with low overall support, many of the relationships between freshwater and marine groups remain unresolved. Normally, phylogenomics could clarify such conclusions, but despite the recent surge in data, virtually no freshwater dinoflagellates have been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, we generated 30 transcriptomes from cultures and single cells collected from freshwater environments to infer a robustly supported phylogenomic tree from 217 conserved genes, resolving at least seven transitions to freshwater in dinoflagellates. Mapping the distribution of ASVs from freshwater environmental samples onto this tree confirms these groups and identifies additional lineages where freshwater dinoflagellates likely remain unsampled. We also sampled two species of Durinskia, a genus of ""dinotoms"" with both marine and freshwater lineages containing Nitzschia-derived tertiary plastids. Ribosomal RNA phylogenies show that the host cells are closely related, but their endosymbionts are likely descended from two distantly-related freshwater Nitzschia species that were acquired in parallel and relatively recently.",39982435

Random mutagenesis approaches provide one of the most powerful strategies available to accomplish untargeted elucidation of gene function. Unfortunately, initial progress in transposon-mediated mutagenesis of <i>Chlamydia</i> has been challenging. To increase efficiency, we developed a plasmid-based system that couples conditional plasmid maintenance with a previously described strategy leveraging inducible expression of the <i>Himar1</i>-derived C9 transposase. Our pOri-Tn(Q) construct was maintained in <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> cultivated with antibiotics but was rapidly cured in the absence of antibiotic selection. pOri-Tn(Q) supported transposition events when transposase expression was induced during infection. Induction was accompanied by loss of the plasmid backbone when penicillin G was used to select for only the transposable element. C9 induction during iterative passaging was used to increase the overall insertion frequency and accumulate an expanded pool of transposon mutants. The approach supported isolation of individual mutant strains from the mixed pool, and whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the recovered strains harbored single insertions.IMPORTANCE<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is a prevalent human pathogen exerting a tremendous negative impact on human health.

Striga germination and growth rely on strigolactones (SLs) exuded by crop roots under phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions, although the mechanism of this host-parasite interaction remains elusive. In this study, transcriptomic and functional analyses of sorghum treated with Pi deficiency or the SL GR24<sup>5DS</sup> identify two ABC transporter G (ABCG) transporters of SL, Sorghum biocolor strigolactones transporter 1 (SbSLT1) and SbSLT2. Using AlphaFold2 and amino acid conversion mutants, we identify highly conserved amino acids in SL transport channels essential for transport function. Sorghum lines with single or double knockouts of these transporters exhibit significantly reduced SL secretion from roots, leading to decreased Striga germination and parasitism in field experiments and consequently reducing the grain loss under Striga infestation. This study thus describes the mechanism of SL exudation in monocots and defines conserved residues essential for SL transporter function, offering a potential strategy for enhancing crop resistance to Striga parasitism.",39947180

This family consists of 16 groups divided into six main types. PLA2 were first isolated from venom toxins and porcine pancreatic juice. The study of these enzymes is currently of great interest, since it has been shown that a number of PLA2 are involved in the processes of carcinogenesis. PLA2 enzymes were characterized in detail in model organisms and humans. However, their presence and functional role in non-model organisms is poorly understood. Such poorly studied taxa include flatworms, a number of species of which are human parasites. Several PLA2 genes have previously been characterized in parasitic flatworms and their possible role in parasite-host interaction has been shown. However, no systematic identification of the PLA2 genes in this taxon has been carried out. The paper provides a search for and a comparative analysis of PLA2 sequences encoded in the genomes of flatworms. 44 species represented by two free-living and 42 parasitic organisms were studied. The analysis was based on identification of orthologous groups of protein-coding genes, taking into account the domain structure of proteins. In flatworms, 12 of the 13 known types of animal A2 phospholipases were found, represented by 11 orthologous groups. Some phospholipases of several types fell into one orthologous group, some types split into several orthogroups in accordance with their domain structure. It has been shown that phospholipases A2 of the calcium-independent type, platelet-activating phospholipases from group G8 and lysosomal phospholipases from group G15 are represented in all large taxa of flatworms and the vast majority of the species studied by us. In free-living flatworms PLA2 genes have multiple copies. In parasitic flatworms, on the contrary, loss of genes occur specifically in individual taxa specifically for groups or subfamilies of PLAs. An orthologous group of secreted phospholipases has been identified, which is represented only in Digenea and this family has undergone duplications in the genomes of opisthorchids. Interestingly, a number of experimental studies have previously shown the effect of Clonorchis sinensis proteins of this orthogroup on the cancer transformation of host cells. Our results made it possible for the first time to systematically identify PLA2 sequences in flatworms, and demonstrated that their evolution is subject to gene loss processes characteristic of parasite genomes in general. In addition, our analysis allowed us to identify taxon-specific processes of duplication and loss of PLA2 genes in parasitic organisms, which may be associated with the processes of their interaction with the host organism.",39944809

The nematode genomes were 379 Mb and 183 Mb in size, with the integrated gene models predicting 40,186 and 18,227 genes in HT and HS, respectively.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Elucidating the evolutionary dynamics of parasitism in Cuscuta: in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction and extensive plastomes reduction.,"The genus Cuscuta L. (Convolvulaceae), commonly known as dodder, is a holoparasite plant that relies on host plants for nutrition, leading to significant genomic changes, particularly in plastomes. This dependency has led to significant reductions and modifications in their plastomes compared to autotrophic plants. In contrast to the well-conserved plastomes of photosynthetic plants, Cuscuta exhibits substantial genomic reductions reflecting the loss of photosynthetic functions and associated genes. This study examines eight plastomes within Cuscuta and reconstructs the phylogenetic relationships among 40 Cuscuta taxa using five other genera as an outgroup. The size of plastid genome varies significantly, with the smallest being 60kb and the largest 121kb, highlighting extensive genomic reduction. In special cases, the subgenera Cuscuta exhibit the loss of inverted repeats, distinguishing from them other subge within the Cuscuta genus. This reduction is most pronounced in genes related to photosynthesis, such as atp, pet, psa, psb, and ycf genes, particularly in the subg. Grammica (Lour.) Peter. The study also notes the frequent and independent loss of the plastid genes infA, rpl23, rpl32, rps15, and rps16 across various angiosperm lineages, often involving transfer to the nuclear genome. In parasitic plants like Cuscuta, the ndh genes, crucial for photosynthesis, are often lost. The study also highlights that in the subg. Grammica, the matK and rpo genes, along with trnR-ACG genes, are lost in parallel, indicating that these parasitic plants do not need matK and rpo genes after the loss of ndh genes for survival. Analysis of selective relaxation pressure on plastid genes shows a reductive trend, with genes such as atp, pet, psa, psb, rpo, and ycf progressively becoming pseudogenes over time, with housekeeping genes like rpl and rps expected to follow. However, the pseudogenization process is specific to the subg. Grammica, Pachystigma (Engelm.) Baker & C.H.Wright, and Cuscuta, rather than in the subg. Monogynella (Des Moul.)

The study of Cuscuta plastomes reveals the profound impact of parasitism on genome evolution, highlighting the complex interplay of gene retention and loss through phylogenomic approaches. This research enriches our understanding of plant genome evolution and the intricate host-parasite relationships. It also sheds light on the evolutionary history and genomic adaptations of Cuscuta, illustrating the diverse strategies enabling subg.

Comprehensive and comparative, year-round assessments of the WAP microbial community dynamics in coastal surface waters at these two locations are imperative to understand the effects of regional climate warming variations on microbial community dynamics, but this is still lacking. We report on the seasonal diversity, taxonomic overview, as well as predicted inter-and intra-domain causal effects (interactions) of the bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities close to the Palmer stationand at theRothera time-series site between July 2013 and April 2014. Our 16S- and 18S-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data showed that across all seasons, both bacteria and microbial eukaryotic communities were considerably different between the two sites which could be attributed to seawater temperature, and sea ice coverage in combination with sea ice type differences. Overall, in terms of biotic drivers, causal-effect modelling suggests that bacteria were stronger drivers of ecosystem dynamics at Palmer, while microbial eukaryotes played a stronger role at Rothera. The parasitic taxa Syndiniales persevered at both sites across the seasons, with Palmer and Rothera harbouring different key groups. Up to 62.3% of the negative causal effects were driven by Syndiniales at Rothera compared to only 13.5% at Palmer, suggesting that parasitism drives community dynamics at Rothera more strongly than at Palmer. Conversely, SAR11 Clade II, which was less abundant but persistent year-round at both sites, was the dominant driver at Palmer, evidenced by many (28.2% and 37.4% of positive and negative effects respectively) strong causal effects.

This study describes the diversity and temporal dynamics of the microeukaryotic community in the biofilm of Mediterranean macroalgae during summer, focusing on parasitic groups. Protist diversity was assessed using metabarcoding sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S rDNA gene using primers biased against metazoans. The macroalgal biofilm exhibited dynamic shifts in the microeukaryotic community structure associated to three phases of biofilm formation. Each phase was characterised by the dominance of specific eukaryotic and parasitic groups with clear successions between them. Our study revealed a high diversity of parasitic protists from different lineages in the macroalgal biofilm. These parasites can infect a wide variety of hosts, including the basibiont, species within the biofilm (micro- and macrocolonizers), nearby marine hosts and terrestrial organisms. The highest diversity and abundance of parasites were found in the mature phase of the biofilm, where the complexity and stability of the system seem to favour parasitism. The parasite assemblage was dominated by Apicomplexa, with many corresponding to unknown diversity, demonstrating that biofilms are a hotspot of unknown parasitic interactions.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Comparative transcriptomics reveal stage-dependent parasitic adaptations in the myxozoan Sphaerospora molnari.,"Parasitism as a life strategy has independently evolved multiple times within the eukaryotic tree of life. Each lineage has developed mechanisms to invade hosts, exploit resources, and ensure replication, but our knowledge of survival mechanisms in many parasitic taxa remain extremely limited. One such group is the Myxozoa, which are obligate, dixenous cnidarians. Evidence suggests that myxozoans evolved from free-living ancestors to endoparasites around 600million years ago and are likely one of the first metazoan parasites on Earth. Some myxozoans pose significant threats to farmed and wild fish populations, negatively impacting aquaculture and fish stocks; one such example is Sphaerospora molnari, which forms spores in the gills of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), disrupting gill epithelia and causing somatic and respiratory failure. Sphaerospora molnari undergoes sequential development in different organs of its host, with large numbers of morphologically distinct stages occurring in the blood, liver, and gills of carp. We hypothesize that these parasite life-stages differ in regards to their host exploitation, pathogenicity, and host immune evasion strategies and mechanisms. We performed stage-specific transcriptomic profiling to identify differentially expressed key functional gene groups that relate to these functions and provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms S. molnari uses to optimize its parasitic lifestyle. We aimed to identify genes that are likely related to parasite pathogenicity and host cell exploitation mechanisms, and we hypothesize that genes unique to S. molnari might be indicative of evolutionary innovations and specific adaptations to host environments. We used parasite isolation protocols and comparative transcriptomics to study early proliferative and spore-forming stages of S. molnari, unveiling variation in gene expression between each stage. We discovered several apparent innovations in the S. molnari transcriptome, including proteins that are likely to function in the uptake of previously unknown key nutrients, immune evasion factors that may contribute to long-term survival in hosts, and proteins that likely improve adhesion to host cells that may have arisen from horizontal gene transfer. Notably, we identified genes that are similar to known virulence factors in other parasitic organisms, particularly blood and intestinal parasites like Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, and Giardia. Many of these genes are absent in published cnidarian and myxozoan datasets and appear to be specific to S. molnari; they may therefore represent potential innovations enabling Sphaerospora to exploit the host's blood system. In order to address the threat posed by myxozoans to both cultured fish species and wild stocks, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of their genetics. Sphaerospora molnari offers an appealing model for stage-specific transcriptomic profiling and for identifying differentially expressed key functional gene groups related to parasite development. We identified genes that are thus far unique to S. molnari, which reveal their evolutionary novelty and likely role as adaptations to specific host niches. In addition, we describe the pathogenicity-associated genetic toolbox of S. molnari and discuss the implications of our discoveries for disease control by shedding light on specific targets for potential intervention strategies.",39901063

In filamentous fungi, some NLRs mediate heterokaryon incompatibility, a self/non-self recognition process that prevents the vegetative fusion of genetically distinct individuals, reducing the risk of parasitism. The <i>het-d</i> and <i>het-e</i> NLRs in <i>Podospora anserina</i> are highly polymorphic incompatibility genes (<i>het</i> genes) whose products recognize different alleles of the <i>het-c</i> gene via a sensor domain composed of WD40 repeats. These repeats display unusually high sequence identity maintained by concerted evolution. However, some sites within individual repeats are hypervariable and under diversifying selection. Despite extensive genetic studies, inconsistencies in the reported WD40 domain sequence have hindered functional and evolutionary analyses. Here we demonstrate that the WD40 domain can be accurately reconstructed from long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio) data, but not from Illumina-based assemblies. Functional alleles are usually formed by 11 highly conserved repeats, with different repeat combinations underlying the same phenotypic <i>het-d</i> and <i>het-e</i> incompatibility reactions. Protein structure models suggest that their WD40 domain folds into two 7-blade -propellers composed of the highly conserved repeats, as well as three cryptic divergent repeats at the C-terminus. We additionally show that one particular <i>het-e</i> allele does not have an incompatibility reaction with common <i>het-c</i> alleles, despite being 11-repeats long. Our findings provide a robust foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of <i>het</i> NLRs, while also highlighting both the fragility and the flexibility of <i></i>-propellers as immune sensor domains.",39868110
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",RNAi-based biocontrol for crops: a revised expectation for a non-recent technology.,"The exogenous application of RNAi technology offers new promises for crops improvement. Cell-based or synthetically produced strands are economical, non-transgenic and could induce the same responses. The substantial population growth demands novel strategies to produce crops without further damaging the environment. RNA interference mechanism is one of the promising technologies to biologically control pests and pathogens in crops, suppressing them by cancelling protein synthesis related to parasitism/pathogenesis. The transgenic approach to generate host-induced gene silencing demonstrated high efficacy in controlling pests or pathogens by RNAi mechanism. However, transgenic technology is tightly regulated and still negatively perceived by global consumers. This review presents the basic biology of small RNA, the main actor of the RNAi mechanism, and tested non-transgenic approaches to induce RNAi exogenously. Novel avenues are offered by the discovery of cross-kingdom RNAi, that naturally, plants also deliver small RNA to suppress the growth of their threats. Future applications of non-transgenic RNAi-based biocontrol will involve the production of dsRNA on an industrial scale. Here, the attempts to provide dsRNA for routine application in farms are also discussed, emphasizing that the technology must be accessible by the countries with the greatest population which mostly are poorer ones.",39862243
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Nymphal feeding suppresses oviposition-induced indirect plant defense in rice.,"Feeding and oviposition by phytophagous insects are both known to trigger defenses in plants. Whether these two defenses functionally interact remains poorly studied, although these interactions are likely important for pests with overlapping generations. Here we investigated the differences and interaction between feeding- and oviposition-induced plant defenses triggered by the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), which gregariously feeds and oviposits on rice. Analyses of host-plant transcriptomes, phytohormones, and direct and indirect defense compounds all show that BPH gravid females (GFs), but not nymphs and non-gravid females (NFs), strongly induce rice defenses. BPH nymphs and GFs prefer to feed on plants previously infested by nymphs over un-attacked plants, but are repelled by plants previously infested by GFs. Moreover, nymph feeding is found to reduce the attractiveness of rice plants to natural enemies and decrease egg parasitism by suppressing GF-induced volatiles that mediate indirect defenses in both growth chambers and paddies. Intergenerational interactions between oviposition- and feeding-induced plant defenses not only promote the development of the population of pest insects but may also contribute to the aggregation behavior of pest insects by suppressing oviposition-induced indirect plant defenses.",39779696
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""","Revealing the Dynamic History of Parasitic Plant Plastomes via Structural Characterization, Comparative Analysis, and Phylogenomics.","<b>Background:</b> The shift to a parasitic lifestyle in plants often leaves distinct marks on their plastid genomes, given the central role plastids play in photosynthesis. Studying these unique adaptations in parasitic plants is essential for understanding the mechanisms and evolutionary patterns driving plastome reduction in angiosperms. By exploring these changes, we can gain deeper insights into how parasitism reshapes the genomic architecture of plants. <b>Method:</b> This study analyzed and compared the plastomes of 113 parasitic plants from different families. <b>Results:</b> The Orobanchaceae family (hemiparasitic plants) displayed the largest plastome size, while Apodanthaceae exhibited the shortest. Additionally, Orobanchaceae showcased little to no gene loss in their plastomes. However, holoparasitic species typically had reduced plastome sizes. Convolvulaceae exhibited significantly reduced plastome sizes due to high gene loss, and Apodanthaceae retained only a few genes. Gene divergence among different families was also investigated, and <i>rps15, rps18,</i> and <i>rpl33</i> in Orobanchaceae; <i>acc</i>D and <i>ycf1</i> in Convolvulaceae; <i>atp</i>F and <i>ccs</i>A <i>i</i>n Loranthaceae; and <i>rpl32</i> in Santalaceae showed greater divergence. Additionally, Orobanchaceae had the highest numbers of all repeat types, whereas Loranthaceae and Convolvulaceae exhibited the lowest repeat numbers. Similarly, more simple sequence repeats were reported in Loranthaceae and Santalaceae. Our phylogenetic analysis also uncovered a distinct clade comprising Loranthaceae, with a single Schoepfiaceae species clustering nearby. Contrary to expectations, parasitic and hemiparasitic plants formed mixed groupings instead of segregating into separate clades. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings offer insights into parasitic plants' evolutionary relationships, revealing shared and divergent genomic features across diverse lineages.",39766844
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Metabolism and immune responses of striped hamsters to ectoparasite challenges: insights from transcriptomic analysis.,"The striped hamster, often parasitized by ectoparasites in nature, is an ideal model for studying host-ectoparasite molecular interactions. Investigating the response to ectoparasites under laboratory conditions helps elucidate the mechanism of host adaptations to ectoparasite pressure. Using transcriptome sequencing, we analyzed gene expression in striped hamsters after short-term (3 days) and long-term (28 days) flea (<i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>) parasitism. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Hub genes were pinpointed using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and the MCODE in Cytoscape. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to further clarify the functional pathways of these hub genes. Validation of DEGs was performed via RT-qPCR. Additionally, the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) were determined using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection kits for hamsters. GO analysis revealed that during early parasitism, hosts primarily responded to the ectoparasites by adjusting the expression of genes related to metabolic functions. As parasitism persisted, the immune response became prominent, activating various immune pathways against ectoparasites. KEGG analysis confirmed the ongoing roles of metabolism and immunity. Notably, the chemical carcinogenesis - reactive oxygen species pathway was upregulated during flea parasitism, with downregulation of hub genes ATP5MC1 and ATP5MC2, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial function in oxidative stress. ELISA findings revealed that on day 3, flea parasitism groups showed elevated ROS expression and reduced SOD and CAT levels compared to the control group. By day 28, only SOD expression showed a significant decrease in both parasitism groups. This study uncovered the dynamic changes in metabolism and immune responses of striped hamsters parasitized by <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>. Hosts adjust their physiological and immune states to optimize survival strategies during different ectoparasite stages, enhancing our understanding of host-ectoparasite interactions. This also paves the way for further research into how hosts regulate complex biological processes in response to ectoparasite challenges.",39723213
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",EXPLORING DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF DERO (ALLODERO) HYLAE IN THEIR PARASITIC AND FREE-LIVING FORMS.,"Parasitism is ubiquitous, yet little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to a parasitic lifestyle. Facultative parasites can switch between free-living and parasitic lifestyles, which may provide an opportunity for researchers to study the genetic mechanisms underlying a transition to parasitism. The oligochaete Dero (Allodero) hylae is a facultative parasite commonly found within the ureter of various anuran species, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis). The Dero hylae worm passes into the frog's cloaca, where it then infects the ureter. In the ureter, the worm loses its free-living characteristics such as hair setae, dorsal setae, a digestive tract, and fossa with gills as it transitions to a parasitic lifestyle. The parasite may be expelled from its host during urination, and when this occurs the worm will reacquire its free-living characteristics. The focus of this study was to compare the differential gene expression profiles observed when this rapid morphological change takes place. Specimens of D. hylae were extracted from wild Cuban tree frogs and either flash-frozen to capture the parasitic RNA gene expression profile or cultured for 2 wk and allowed to metamorphose to their free-living stage and then flash-frozen. The extracted RNA was used for de novo transcriptome assembly, and we conducted a differential gene expression analysis using an RNA Tag-Seq approach for both the free-living and parasitic life forms. Based on these results, we identified 213 differentially expressed transcripts between the 2 developmental forms, with 190 of these up-regulated in the free-living life form. Although over half of the differential genes recovered did not result in any significant BLAST hits, many of these genes did provide insight into which molecular signals are potentially used after the parasite transforms into the free-living form. This analysis provides significant insight into differentially expressed transcripts associated with the drastic morphological changes observed in this rare case of oligochaete parasitism by D. hylae encompassing both free-living and parasitic forms.",39701158
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Intra-individual polymorphisms in the mitochondrial COI gene of tick-killing Ixodiphagus wasps parasitizing Haemaphysalis flava ticks.,"Ixodid ticks are significant vectors of pathogens affecting both humans and animals. Biological control with natural enemies represents a sustainable tool for managing ticks. However, there is a substantial lack of knowledge about the natural enemies of ticks. Wasps of the genus Ixodiphagus (Encyrtidae) are currently the only known tick-specific parasitoids. While these wasps have been sporadically recorded worldwide, their presence in Eastern Asia is poorly documented. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of Ixodiphagus wasps in field-collected ticks reared on rabbits under laboratory conditions. Ticks were collected from the Hokkaido, Hokuriku, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions in Japan. Out of 1,933 Haemaphysalis ticks infested on rabbits, adult wasps emerged from 15 engorged ticks. All the ticks from which wasps emerged were morphologically and molecularly identified as Haemaphysalis flava. Additionally, wasp DNA was detected in unfed H. flava nymphs using a newly designed Ixodiphagus-specific PCR assay. Among nine experimental sites in the Chugoku region, Ixodiphagus wasps were detected at three sites, with parasitism rates ranging from 1.8 % to 8.1 %. Finally, the mitochondrial COI gene sequences of four wasp and two tick samples were characterized using shotgun sequencing, direct sequencing, and in-fusion cloning approaches. Multiple intra-individual polymorphisms were observed in all the tested samples. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between Ixodiphagus wasps and Ixodid ticks. An increased understanding of these parasitoid wasps could contribute to future biological control measures against ticks.",39694398
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",The telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome provides insights into the evolution of specialized centromere sequences in sandalwood.,"Sandalwood, a prized hemiparasitic plant, is highly sought in the commercial market because of its aromatic core materia. The structure and stability of the genome are instrumental in the rapid adaptation of parasitic plants to their surroundings. However, there is a conspicuous lack of research on the genomic-level adaptive evolution of sandalwood. In this study, we assembled a gap-free telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genome for Santalum album using PacBio HiFi, Hi-C, and ultra-long ONT data. The T2T reference genome (Sal_t2t) encompassed annotations of 24,171 genes and 25.34% repetitive sequences, in addition to all 10 centromeres and 20 telomeres across the 10 chromosomes. The results revealed that the 3 distinct parasitic species of Santalales had diverse centromeric compositions. The Copia-type long terminal repeat transposon emerged as the most significant in the S. album genome, constituting the primary sequence of the centromere and influencing gene expression. Third, in sandalwood, the presence of Copia affected the size of the centromeres and, consequently, the genome size. Identification of the sandalwood T2T genome in this study also enabled the identification of more precise organelle transfer fragments. Our research provides a sandalwood T2T genome, laying the groundwork for future investigations on the evolution of energy organs in parasitic plants. Moreover, it offers novel insights into the function and evolution of centromeres, as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and parasitism.",39661724
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Cell Wall Dynamics in the Parasitic Plant (<i>Striga</i>) and Rice Pathosystem.,"In the plant-plant pathosystem of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and the parasitic plant <i>Striga hermonthica</i>, cell walls from either plant are important defensive and offensive structures. Here, we reveal the cell wall dynamics in both <i>Striga</i> and rice using simultaneous RNA sequencing. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to home in on cell wall modification processes occurring in interactions with a resistant rice cultivar (Nipponbare) compared with a susceptible one (IAC 165). Likewise, we compared the cell wall dynamics in <i>Striga</i> infecting resistant and susceptible rice. Our study revealed an intense battlement at the <i>Striga-</i>rice cell walls involving both parasite (offense) and host (defense) factors, the outcome of which makes the difference between successful or failed parasitism. <i>Striga</i> activates genes encoding cell wall-degrading enzymes to gain access to the host, expansins to allow for cell elongation, and pectin methyl esterase inhibitors for rigidity during infection. In the susceptible host, immune response processes are not induced, and <i>Striga</i>-derived cell wall-degrading enzymes easily breach the host cell wall, resulting in successful parasitism. In contrast, the resistant host invokes immune responses modulated by phytohormones to fortify the cell wall through polysaccharides and lignin deposition. Through these processes, the cell wall of the resistant host successfully obstructs parasite entry. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of practical agriculture in which cell wall modification can be used to manage parasitic plants.

In this context, in the present study, 10 specific T-cell epitopes from 5 parasite proteins, which were identified by antibodies in VL patients sera, were selected and used to construct a gene codifying the new chimeric protein called rCHI. The rCHI vaccine was developed and thoroughly evaluated for its potential effectiveness against <i>Leishmania infantum</i> infection.

The antigenic profile of <i>T. gondii</i> is complex, and the immune response can lead to either susceptibility or resistance. Some antigens, such as surface antigen glycoprotein (SAG), are expressed on the surface of tachyzoite stages and interact with the host immune cells. In this study, we investigated the potential of the recombinant SAG2A protein of <i>T. gondii</i> to control parasitism and modulate the immune response in the peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) of both susceptible (C57BL/6) and resistant (BALB/c) mice using an in vitro infection model, gene expression, proteomic analysis, and bioinformatic tools. Our results showed that rSAG2A-treated PECs presented a lower parasitism in C57BL/6 mice but not in the PECs from BALB/c mice, and induced a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in C57BL/6 mice (<i>iNOS</i>, <i>TNF-</i>, and <i>IL-6</i>). rSAG2A modulated different exclusive proteins in each mouse lineage, with PECs from the C57BL/6 mice being more sensitive to modulation by rSAG2A. Additionally, biological processes crucial to parasite survival and immune response were modulated by rSAG2A in the C57BL/6 PECs, including fatty acid beta-oxidation, reactive oxygen species metabolism, interferon production, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Together, our study indicates that rSAG2A controls <i>T. gondii</i> parasitism in susceptible C57BL/6 PECs through the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced expression of proteins involved in the cytotoxic response.",39597754

This symbiont, found in Anopheles mosquitoes, can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally with minimal effects on its mosquito host. Its genome, recently sequenced from An. arabiensis, comprises a compact 5.9 Mbp. Here, we analyze the Microsporidia sp.

Unlike other members of the Enterocytozoonida group, Microsporidia sp. MB has retained most of the genes in the glycolytic pathway. Genes involved in RNA interference (RNAi) were also identified, suggesting a mechanism for host immune suppression. Importantly, meiosis-related genes (MRG) were detected, indicating potential for sexual reproduction in this organism. Comparative analyses revealed similarities with its closest relative, Vittaforma corneae, despite key differences in host interactions. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the newly sequenced Microsporidia sp. MB genome, uncovering its unique adaptations for intracellular parasitism, including retention of essential metabolic pathways and RNAi machinery. The identification of MRGs suggests the possibility of sexual reproduction, offering insights into the symbiont's evolutionary strategies. Establishing a reference genome for Microsporidia sp.

However, the regulatory function of lncRNAs during plant-nematode interaction remains largely elusive. In this study, we investigated the differential regulation and function of lncRNAs during two different stages of tomato infection by the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>. At the early stage of infection, 2,218 and 2,827 lncRNAs were regulated locally in the <i>M. incognita</i>-induced galls and systemically in the neighboring root cells, respectively. However, at the later stage of infection, the number of <i>M. incognita</i>-regulated lncRNAs was dramatically reduced, with only 49 lncRNAs being identified as differentially expressed. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to encode peptides with functionally annotated domains, providing insights into the potential roles of these peptides in regulating gene expression, RNA stability and splicing, and protein-protein-interactions. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 55 were found to contain putative binding sites for 56 microRNAs (miRNAs). Overexpressing five of these lncRNAs significantly increased tomato resistance to <i>M. incognita</i>, supporting the functional importance of lncRNAs for establishing tomato-<i>M. incognita</i> interaction. Functional analysis of the target mimicry of lncRNAs towards miRNAs resulted in the identification of two novel regulatory modules involving miR47 and miR156e-5p and their targeted genes that regulate tomato responses to <i>M. incognita</i> parasitism.

Sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene of eukaryotes from seven locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, allowed for the detection of five genera of parasites in caribou feces (including Nematodirella and Parelaphostrongylus) with variable frequency of occurrence depending on sampling location and sex. Our workflow also revealed a rich winter plant and lichen diet in caribou, with respectively 29 and 18 genera identified across all samples through plant and fungal ITS2 sequencing. Relationships between the gut microbiota and both the diet and parasite richness were also identified. Of note, the Central Saskatchewan sampling location was characterized by a clearly distinct gut microbiota which could be linked to an epiphytic lichen-rich diet.

Eggs and young larvae may be parasitised by a complex of hymenopteran parasitoids belonging to the Pteromalidae and Platygastridae families which contributes to natural pest control. We have developed molecular tools for detecting and identifying seven parasitoid species previously encountered in Belgium inside individual wheat midge larvae. Barcode DNA sequences from COI, 18S and 28S genes were obtained from the midges and parasitoid species. Each of the three genes allowed all the species to be distinguished although 18S was the only one displaying a barcoding gap, both between parasitoids and midges, and at the species level. Based on the 18S gene, we developed a TaqMan assay to assess parasitism in midge larvae, regardless of the midge and parasitoid species. Next, two group-specific PCR primer pairs were generated, allowing the separate amplification of midge DNA or parasitoid DNA in parasitised individuals and subsequent identification by Sanger sequencing.

Immunofluorescence assay showed that parasitism induced Chilo suppressalis larvae to produce large numbers of granulocytes, but high temperatures led to granulocytes apoptosis and loss of phagocytosis. In addition, high temperatures activated the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic pathway, leading to apoptosis of prohemocytes. In the present study, the initiator Cscaspase-8 was obtained from the rice pest C. suppressalis. The results of real-time PCR showed that Cscaspase-8 expression was highest in hemocytes; furthermore, transcription was most highly in female adults. Cscaspase-8 was significantly induced when larvae were exposed to 39C for a 2-h period. Cscaspase-8 expression was significantly elevated after 2 d of parasitism. Results of the interference test showed that the survival rate of C. suppressalis larvae is not affected by Cscaspase-8 gene silencing under high temperature and parasitism stress.

This study employed comparative transcriptomics to investigate the mechanisms underlying the parasitism of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> on melon, focusing on both resistant and susceptible interactions. The findings indicate that the critical phase of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> parasitism occurs during the post-attachment stage. It is suggested that peptidases may play a role in the development of invasive cells, while cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) are likely involved in cell wall modification and degradation, and transferases, elicitors, and effectors may play a role in immune regulation. In this study, 25 tobacco rattle virus (TRV) recombinant vectors were successfully constructed and functionally validated using a host-induced gene silencing assay to explore the functions of candidate-secreted effector proteins.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",A major role of class III HD-ZIPs in promoting sugar beet cyst nematode parasitism in Arabidopsis.,"Cyst nematodes use a stylet to secrete CLE-like peptide effector mimics into selected root cells of their host plants to hijack endogenous plant CLE signaling pathways for feeding site (syncytium) formation. Here, we identified ATHB8, encoding a HD-ZIP III family transcription factor, as a downstream component of the CLE signaling pathway in syncytium formation. ATHB8 is expressed in the early stages of syncytium initiation, and then transitions to neighboring cells of the syncytium as it expands; an expression pattern coincident with auxin response at the infection site. Conversely, MIR165a, which expresses in endodermal cells and moves into the vasculature to suppress HD-ZIP III TFs, is down-regulated near the infection site. Knocking down HD-ZIP III TFs by inducible over-expression of MIR165a in Arabidopsis dramatically reduced female development of the sugar beet cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). HD-ZIP III TFs are known to function downstream of auxin to promote cellular quiescence and define stem cell organizer cells in vascular patterning. Taken together, our results suggest that HD-ZIP III TFs function together with a CLE and auxin signaling network to promote syncytium formation, possibly by inducing root cells into a quiescent status and priming them for initial syncytial cell establishment and/or subsequent cellular incorporation.",39509386

The occurrence of root-knot nematode (RKN), Meloidogyne incognita, and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; Begomovirus coheni) has been reported in most tomato cultivation areas. We investigated the interaction between RKN and TYLCV in tomato plants at phenotypic, biochemical, and gene expression levels. Several treatments were considered including mock inoculation, inoculation with TYLCV or RKN alone, simultaneous inoculation with both TYLCV and RKN, and sequential inoculations with a five-day interval. Among them, simultaneous inoculation showed the highest impact on RKN suppression compared to mock-inoculated plants. Biochemical assays in the time-point experiments demonstrated that the pick of defense capacity of plants occurs at 48- and 72-h post-inoculation. Gene expression analyses utilizing marker genes from main hormonal pathways involved in plant defense, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET), indicated that ET and SA are highly involved in the potentiation of TYLCV-induced defense against RKN. To validate the action of SA and ET in the induction of defense against RKN by TYLCV, transgenic lines deficient in SA (NahG) and ET (ACD) accumulation were co-inoculated with TYLCV and RKN. Both transgenic lines failed to express TYLCV-induced defense against RKN.

We measured immune reactions post-infestation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and explored the effects of ectoparasitic infestation on the diversity and composition of the rodent gut microbiota in microbiome studies by 16S rRNA gene sequencing techniques. After flea infestation, results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing techniques indicated a significant increase in alpha diversity, affecting the composition of the gut microbiota. At the genus level, the abundance of the harmful bacterium Desulfovibrio increased. Beta diversity analyses showed significant differences between the gut microbiota of the experimental and control groups. ELISA results revealed significantly elevated levels of IgG in parasitized mice, while the differences in IgA levels were not significant. Flea infections affect the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in the M. unguiculatu, and it has been found that the biomarker Desulfovibrio increases following flea infection in these rodents. Our results indicate that the gut microbiota can regulate the stability of the rodent-flea system. These findings may provide a foundation for exploring preventive measures against plague and aid in developing more effective treatments for the infection.",39453579
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Carbon and Nitrogen Sources Influence Parasitic Responsiveness in <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> NI-1.,"Parasitic species of <i>Trichoderma</i> use hydrolytic enzymes to destroy the host cell wall. Preferent carbon and nitrogen sources suppress the expression of genes related to parasitism. Here, different nutrients were evaluated in the parasitic isolated NI-1, which was identified as <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i>. The genes <i>cbh1</i> and <i>chb2</i> (cellobiohydrolases), <i>bgl3.1</i> (endoglucanase), and <i>pra1</i> and <i>prb1</i> (proteinases) were poorly expressed during the interaction between NI-1 and <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> on PDA. However, gene expression improved on minimal medium with preferent and alternative carbon sources. Dextrin and glucose stimulated higher transcript levels than cellulose, sucrose, and glycerol. Also, ammonium stimulated a stronger parasitic responsiveness than the alternative nitrogen sources. During interaction against different phytopathogens, NI-1 detects their host differentially from a distance due to the <i>cbh1</i> and <i>cbh2</i> genes being only induced by <i>P. capsici</i>. The <i>pra1</i> and <i>ech42</i> genes were induced before contact with <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, while when confronted with <i>P. capsici</i> they were stimulated until contact and overgrowth.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Characterizing virulence differences in a parasitoid wasp through comparative transcriptomic and proteomic.,"Two strains of the endoparasitoid Cotesia typhae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) present a differential parasitism success on the host, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). One is virulent on both permissive and resistant host populations, and the other only on the permissive host. This interaction provides a very interesting frame for studying virulence factors. Here, we used a combination of comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to unravel the molecular basis underlying virulence differences between the strains. First, we report that virulence genes are mostly expressed during the pupal stage 24h before adult emergence of the parasitoid. Especially, 55 proviral genes are up-regulated at this stage, while their expression is only expected in the host. Parasitoid gene expression in the host increases from 24 to 96h post-parasitism, revealing the expression of 54 proviral genes at early parasitism stage and the active participation of teratocytes to the parasitism success at the late stage. Secondly, comparison between strains reveals differences in venom composition, with 12 proteins showing differential abundance. Proviral expression in the host displays a strong temporal variability, along with differential patterns between strains. Notably, a subset of proviral genes including protein-tyrosine phosphatases is specifically over-expressed in the resistant host parasitized by the less virulent strain, 24h after parasitism. This result particularly hints at host modulation of proviral expression. Combining proteomic and transcriptomic data at various stages, we identified 8 candidate genes to support the difference in reproductive success of the two strains, one proviral and 7 venom genes, one of them being also produced within the host by the teratocytes. This study sheds light on the temporal expression of virulence factors of Cotesia typhae, both in the host and in the parasitoid. It also identifies potential molecular candidates driving differences in parasitism success between two strains. Together, those findings provide a path for further exploration of virulence mechanisms in parasitoid wasps, and offer insights into host-parasitoid coevolution.",39375606

Genome research on dinoflagellates has lagged due to their immense genome sizes in most species (~1-250 Gbp). Nevertheless, the last decade marked a fruitful era of dinoflagellate genomics, with 27 genomes sequenced and many insights attained. This review aims to synthesize information from these genomes, along with other omic data, to reflect on where we are now in understanding dinoflagellates and where we are heading in the future. The most notable insights from the decade-long genomics work include: (1) dinoflagellate genomes have been expanded in multiple times independently, probably by a combination of rampant retroposition, accumulation of repetitive DNA, and genome duplication; (2) Symbiodiniacean genomes are highly divergent, but share about 3,445 core unigenes concentrated in 219 KEGG pathways; (3) Most dinoflagellate genes are encoded unidirectionally and are not intron-poor; (4) The dinoflagellate nucleus has undergone extreme evolutionary changes, including complete or nearly complete loss of nucleosome and histone H1, and acquisition of dinoflagellate viral nuclear protein (DVNP); (5) Major basic nuclear protein (MBNP), histone-like protein (HLP), and bacterial HU-like protein (HCc) belong to the same protein family, and MBNP can be the unifying name; (6) Dinoflagellate gene expression is regulated by poorly understood mechanisms, but microRNA and other epigenetic mechanisms are likely important; (7) Over 50% of dinoflagellate genes are ""dark"" and their functions remain to be deciphered using functional genetics; (8) Initial insights into the genomic basis of parasitism and mutualism have emerged.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains play an important role in pathogenesis in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.,"Tetraspanins (TSPANs) are a family of highly conserved proteins present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Although protein-protein interactions of TSPANs have been well established in eukaryotes including parasitic protists, the role they play in parasitism and pathogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized three representative members of TSPANs, TSPAN4, TSPAN12, and TSPAN13 from the human intestinal protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TSPAN4, TSPAN12 and TSPAN13 are reciprocally pulled down together with several other TSPAN-interacting proteins including TSPAN binding protein of 55kDa (TBP55) and interaptin. Blue native-PAGE analysis showed that these TSPANs form several complexes of 120-250 kDa. Repression of tspan12 and tspan13 gene expression led to decreased secretion of cysteine proteases, while repression of tspan4 led to a four-fold increase in the activity of cysteine proteases in crude extracellular vesicles (EVs) fraction. Meanwhile, strains overexpressing HA-tagged TSPAN12 and TSPAN13 demonstrated reduced adhesion to collagen. Altogether, this study reveals that the TSPANs, especially TSPAN12 and TSPAN13, are engaged with complex protein-protein interactions and are involved in the pathogenicity-related biological functions such as protease secretion and adhesion, offering insights into the potential regulatory mechanisms of tetraspanins in protozoan parasites.",39361713

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",The potato RNA metabolism machinery is targeted by the cyst nematode effector RHA1B for successful parasitism.,"The potato (Solanum tuberosum) cyst nematode Globodera pallida induces a multinucleate feeding site (syncytium) in potato roots as its sole source of nutrition. Here, we demonstrate that the G. pallida effector RING-H2 finger A1b (RHA1B), which is a functional ubiquitin ligase, interferes with the carbon catabolite repression 4 (CCR4)-negative on TATA-less (NOT) deadenylase-based RNA metabolism machinery that regulates syncytium development in G. pallida-infected potato. Specifically, RHA1B targets the CCR4-associated factor 1 (CAF1) and StNOT10 subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex for proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to upregulation of the cyclin gene StCycA2 involved in syncytium formation. The StCAF1 subunit of CCR4-NOT recruits the RNA binding protein StPUM5 to deadenylate StCycA2 mRNA, resulting in shortened poly-A tails of StCycA2 mRNA and subsequently reduced transcript levels. Knockdown of either subunit (StCAF1 or StNOT10) of the CCR4-NOT complex or StPUM5 in transgenic potato plants resulted in enlarged syncytia and enhanced susceptibility to G. pallida infection, which resembles the phenotypes of StCycA2 overexpression transgenic potato plants. Genetic analyses indicate that transgenic potato plants overexpressing RHA1B exhibit similar phenotypes as transgenic potato plants with knockdown of StNOT10, StCAF1, or StPUM5. Thus, our data suggest that G. pallida utilizes the RHA1B effector to manipulate RNA metabolism in host plants, thereby promoting syncytium development for parasitic success.",39325717

However, different approaches, such as the combination of morphological, molecular, and ecological data, have provided advances in identifying and delimiting rhabdiasid species. Here, we describe a new species of <i>Rhabdias</i> from the south of Brazil, with morphological and molecular data. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by having an elongated body, evident cephalic dilation, larger buccal capsule, and large esophagus. In addition to morphological characteristics, we observed significant genetic divergence among the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence of the new species and the closest available sequence, <i>Rhabdias fuelleborni</i> (10.24%-10.87%).

These highly polyphagous nematodes engage in sophisticated interactions with host plants that results in the formation of knot-like structures known as galls whose ontogeny remains largely unknown. Here, we determined transcriptome changes and alternative splicing variants induced by <i>Megalaima incognita</i> in galls and neighboring root cells at two distinct infective stages. <i>M. incognita</i> induced substantial transcriptome changes in tomato roots both locally in galls and systemically in neighboring cells. A considerable parallel regulation of gene expression in galls and neighboring cells were detected, indicative of effective intercellular communications exemplified by suppression of basal defense responses particularly during the early stage of infection. The transcriptome analysis also revealed that <i>M. incognita</i> exerts a tight control over the cell cycle process as a whole that results in an increase of ploidy levels in the feeding sites and accelerated mitotic activity of the gall cells. Alternative splicing analysis indicated that <i>M. incognita</i> significantly modulates pre-mRNA splicing as a total of 9064 differentially spliced events from 2898 genes were identified where intron retention and exon skipping events were largely suppressed. Furthermore, a number of differentially spliced events were functionally validated using transgenic hairy root system and found to impact gall formation and nematode egg mass production.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",WOX11-mediated cell size control in Arabidopsis attenuates growth and fecundity of endoparasitic cyst nematodes.,"Cyst nematodes establish permanent feeding structures called syncytia inside the host root vasculature, disrupting the flow of water and minerals. In response, plants form WOX11-mediated adventitious lateral roots at nematode infection sites. WOX11 adventitious lateral rooting modulates tolerance to nematode infections; however, whether this also benefits nematode parasitism remains unknown. Here, we report on bioassays using a 35S::WOX11-SRDX transcriptional repressor mutant to investigate whether WOX11 adventitious lateral rooting promotes syncytium development and thereby female growth and fecundity. Moreover, we chemically inhibited cellulose biosynthesis to verify if WOX11 directly modulates cell wall plasticity in syncytia. Finally, we performed histochemical analyses to test if WOX11 mediates syncytial cell wall plasticity via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Repression of WOX11-mediated transcription specifically enhanced the radial expansion of syncytial elements, increasing both syncytium size and female offspring. The enhanced syncytial hypertrophy observed in the 35S::WOX11-SRDX mutant could be phenocopied by chemical inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis and was associated with elevated levels of ROS at nematode infection sites. We, therefore, conclude that WOX11 restricts radial expansion of nematode-feeding structures and female growth and fecundity, likely by modulating ROS-mediated cell wall plasticity mechanisms. Remarkably, this novel role of WOX11 in plant cell size control is distinct from WOX11 adventitious lateral rooting underlying disease tolerance.",39276334
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Dominant-Negative KAI2d Paralogs Putatively Attenuate Strigolactone Responses in Root Parasitic Plants.,"Many root parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae use host-derived strigolactones (SLs) as germination cues. This adaptation facilitates attachment to a host and is particularly important for the success of obligate parasitic weeds that cause substantial crop losses globally. Parasite seeds sense SLs through 'divergent' KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2d)/HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT /-hydrolases that have undergone substantial duplication and diversification in Orobanchaceae genomes. After germination, chemotropic growth of parasite roots toward a SL source also occurs in some species. We investigated which of the seven KAI2d genes found in a facultative hemiparasite, Phtheirospermum japonicum, may enable chemotropic responses to SLs. To do so, we developed a triple mutant Nbd14a,b kai2i line of Nicotiana benthamiana in which SL-induced degradation of SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) 1 (SMAX1), an immediate downstream target of KAI2 signaling, is disrupted. In combination with a transiently expressed, ratiometric reporter of SMAX1 protein abundance, this mutant forms a system for the functional analysis of parasite KAI2d proteins in a plant cellular context. Using this system, we unexpectedly found three PjKAI2d proteins that do not trigger SMAX1 degradation in the presence of SLs. Instead, these PjKAI2d proteins inhibit the perception of low SL concentrations by SL-responsive PjKAI2d in a dominant-negative manner that depends upon an active catalytic triad. Similar dominant-negative KAI2d paralogs were identified in an obligate hemiparasitic weed, Striga hermonthica. These proteins suggest a mechanism for attenuating SL signaling in parasites, which might be used to enhance the perception of shallow SL gradients during root growth toward a host or to restrict germination responses to specific SLs.",39275795
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Root-knot nematodes exploit the catalase-like effector to manipulate plant reactive oxygen species levels by directly degrading H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.,"Plants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon infection, which typically trigger defence mechanisms and impede pathogen proliferation. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs, Meloidogyne spp.) represent highly detrimental pathogens capable of parasitizing a broad spectrum of crops, resulting in substantial annual agricultural losses. The involvement of ROS in RKN parasitism is well acknowledged. In this study, we identified a novel effector from Meloidogyne incognita, named CATLe, that contains a conserved catalase domain, exhibiting potential functions in regulating host ROS levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CATLe is conserved across RKNs. Temporal and spatial expression assays showed that the CATLe gene was specifically up-regulated at the early infection stages and accumulated in the subventral oesophageal gland cells of M. incognita. Immunolocalization demonstrated that CATLe was secreted into the giant cells of the host plant during M. incognita parasitism. Transient expression of CATLe significantly dampened the flg22-induced ROS production in Nicotiana benthamiana. In planta assays confirmed that M. incognita can exploit CATLe to manipulate host ROS levels by directly degrading H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, interfering with expression of the CATLe gene through double-stranded RNA soaking and host-induced gene silencing significantly attenuated M. incognita parasitism, highlighting the important role of CATLe. Taken together, our results suggest that RKNs can directly degrade ROS products using a functional catalase, thereby manipulating host ROS levels and facilitating parasitism.",39254175

Its predatory habits contribute to the infection, dispersion, and continuation of the life cycle of various pathogens, including helminths, within ecosystems. However, few studies involving cestodes in wild felines are found in the literature, especially in Brazil. Therefore, we aimed to report the first case of parasitism by Hydatigera taeniaeformis in L. geoffroyi. The helminths were found in the small intestine of the necropsied feline. Specimens were analyzed morphometrically and subjected to molecular analyses for taxonomic identification. The molecular phylogeny based on the analysis of the mitochondrial gene (COX1) allowed the identification of these parasites. Thus, this is the first description of H. taeniaeformis parasitizing L. geoffroyi in Brazil.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Plastome evolution in Santalales involves relaxed selection prior to loss of ndh genes and major boundary shifts of the inverted repeat.,"Biological aspects of haustorial parasitism have significant effects on the configuration of the plastid genome. Approximately half the diversity of haustorial parasites belongs to the order Santalales, where a clearer picture of plastome evolution in relation to parasitism is starting to emerge. However, in previous studies of plastome evolution there is still a notable under-representation of members from non-parasitic and deep-branching hemiparasitic lineages, limiting evolutionary inference around the time of transition to a parasitic lifestyle. To expand taxon sampling relevant to this transition we therefore targeted three families of non-parasites (Erythropalaceae, Strombosiaceae and Coulaceae), two families of root-feeding hemiparasites (Ximeniaceae and Olacaceae) and two families of uncertain parasitic status (Aptandraceae and Octoknemaceae). With data from these lineages we aimed to explore plastome evolution in relation to the evolution of parasitism. From 29 new samples we sequenced and annotated plastomes and the nuclear ribosomal cistron. We examined phylogenetic patterns, plastome evolution, and patterns of relaxed or intensified selection in plastid genes. Available transcriptome data were analysed to investigate potential transfer of infA to the nuclear genome. Phylogenetic relationships indicate a single functional loss of all plastid ndh genes (ndhA-K) in a clade formed by confirmed parasites and Aptandraceae, and the loss coincides with major size and boundary shifts of the inverted repeat (IR) region. Depending on an autotrophic or heterotrophic lifestyle in Aptandraceae, plastome changes are either correlated with or pre-date the evolution of parasitism. Phylogenetic patterns also indicate repeated loss of infA from the plastome, and based on the presence of transcribed sequences with presequences corresponding to thylakoid luminal transit peptides, we infer that the genes were transferred to the nuclear genome. Except for the loss of the ndh complex, relatively few genes have been lost from the plastome in deep-branching root parasites in Santalales. Prior to loss of the ndh genes, they show signs of relaxed selection indicative of their dispensability. To firmly establish a potential correlation between ndh gene loss, plastome instability and evolution of parasitism, it is pertinent to refute or confirm a parasitic lifestyle in all Santalales clades.",39213003

These effects enabled efficient dissemination of the type II <i>T. gondii</i> lineage, a highly prevalent genotype in humans. We identify novel functions for effectors GRA15 and GRA24 in promoting CCR7-mediated macrophage chemotaxis by acting on NF-B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, respectively, with contributions by GRA16/18 and counter-regulation by effector TEEGR. Furthermore, GRA28 boosted chromatin accessibility and GRA15/24/NF-B-dependent transcription at the <i>Ccr7</i> gene locus in primary macrophages. <i>In vivo</i>, adoptively transferred macrophages infected with wild-type <i>T. gondii</i> outcompeted macrophages infected with a GRA15/24 double mutant in migrating to secondary organs in mice. The data show that <i>T. gondii</i>, rather than being passively shuttled, actively promotes its dissemination by inducing a finely regulated pro-migratory state in parasitized human and murine phagocytes via co-operating polymorphic GRA effectors. Intracellular pathogens can hijack the cellular functions of infected host cells to their advantage, for example, for intracellular survival and dissemination. However, how microbes orchestrate the hijacking of complex cellular processes, such as host cell migration, remains poorly understood. As such, the common parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> actively invades the immune cells of humans and other vertebrates and modifies their migratory properties. Here, we show that the concerted action of a number of secreted effector proteins from the parasite, principally GRA15 and GRA24, acts on host cell signaling pathways to activate chemotaxis. Furthermore, the protein effector GRA28 selectively acted on chromatin accessibility in the host cell nucleus to selectively boost host gene expression. The joint activities of GRA effectors culminated in pro-migratory signaling within the infected phagocyte. We provide a molecular framework delineating how <i>T. gondii</i> can orchestrate a complex biological phenotype, such as the migratory activation of phagocytes to boost dissemination.",39207098

Infected Briareum violacea will undergo tissue ulceration and death within a short period of time. This ciliate was identified as Scuticociliatia sp. through 18S rRNA gene identification. In this study, the body length of the ciliate was approximately 80-85m before parasitizing the B. violacea. After being parasitizing, the body length was approximately 200-250m, and the body width was 50m. Body size increased three times after parasitism. According to observations, ciliates will first parasitize the coral endoderm in the early stage of infection, and no ciliates were found in the ectoderm. Preliminary judgment suggests that it may invade the coral endoderm through the mouth for parasitism. After parasitism, the ciliate eats the coral tissue and zooxanthellae. The antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and MDA of infected corals were significantly increased, which also means that the corals are in a stress response. Ciliates will eat the zooxanthellae in the coral body, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of zooxanthellae and chlorophyll a.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""","The first report of digenean infecting short mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma) from Chon Buri Province, the Gulf of Thailand.","Rastrelliger brachysoma (Bleeker, 1851), the short mackerel, is a dietary staple and of significant economic demand in Southeast Asia and Thailand. However, the demand for short mackerel has precipitated an overfishing crisis, leading to a depletion of fish stocks. Overfishing, coupled with parasitism, may result in a decline in the population of R. brachysoma. Digenetic trematode infection is prevalent in marine fish and has a considerable impact on the overall health of the fish. Here, to identify digenetic trematodes infecting R. brachysoma, we aim to determine the identity, prevalence, and intensity of digenean infections in R. brachysoma from the Gulf of Thailand. A total of 194 short mackerel were obtained from Chon Buri Province, where digeneans were isolated and identified. The molecular identity of the digeneans was confirmed using the nuclear 28S rRNA gene. Of the 194 short mackerel, 100% were found to be infected with digeneans, comprising of Lecithocladium, Prodistomum, Opechona, and Aphanurus. Lecithocladium was the most prevalent (98%) and had the highest intensity of infection (37 mean intensity), followed by Prodistomum (75% prevalence and 17 mean intensity). Our study thus presents the first evidence of digeneans infecting the economically important short mackerel from the Gulf of Thailand. The high infection rate of digenetic trematodes may have implications on the health of R. brachysoma, further driving their population decline. These data underscore the importance of safeguarding fisheries resources in the Gulf of Thailand, and downstream conservation efforts are crucial for evidence-based management decisions to safeguard the long-term sustainability of fish resources.",39107443
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Winter break? The effect of overwintering on immune gene expression in wood frogs.,"Among terrestrial ectotherms, hibernation is a common response to extreme cold temperatures and is associated with reduced physiological rates, including immunity. When winter wanes and temperatures increase, so too do vital rates of both ectothermic hosts and their parasites. Due to metabolic scaling, if parasite activity springs back faster than host immune functions then cold seasons and transitions between cold and warm seasons may represent periods of vulnerability for ectothermic hosts. Understanding host regulation of physiological rates at seasonal junctions is a first step toward identifying thermal mismatches between hosts and parasites. Here we show that immune gene expression is responsive to transitions into and out of the cold season in a winter-adapted amphibian, the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), and that frogs experienced parasitism by at least two nematode species throughout the entirety of the cold season. In both splenic and skin tissues, we observed a decrease in immune gene expression going from fall to winter, observed no changes between winter and emergence from hibernation, and observed increases in immune gene expression after hibernation ended. At all timepoints, differentially expressed genes from spleens were more highly enriched for immune system processes than those from ventral skin, especially with respect to terms related to adaptive immune processes. Infection with nematode lungworms was also associated with upregulation of immune processes in the spleen. We suggest that rather than being a period of stagnation, during which physiological processes and infection potential cease, the cold season is immunologically dynamic, requiring coordinated regulation of many biological processes, and that the reemergence period may be an important time during which hosts invest in preparatory immunity.",39096759
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Drivers of interlineage variability in mitogenomic evolutionary rates in Platyhelminthes.,"Studies of forces driving interlineage variability in the evolutionary rates (both sequence and architecture) of mitochondrial genomes often produce contradictory results. Flatworms (Platyhelminthes) exhibit the fastest-evolving mitogenomic sequences among all bilaterian phyla. To test the effects of multiple factors previously associated with different aspects of mitogenomic evolution, we used mitogenomes of 223 flatworm species, phylogenetic multilevel regression models, and causal inference. Thermic host environment (endothermic vs. ectothermic) had nonsignificant impacts on both sequence evolution and mitogenomic size. Mitogenomic gene order rearrangements (GORR) were mostly positively correlated with mitogenomic size (R<sup>2</sup>20-30%). Longevity was not (negatively) correlated with sequence evolution in flatworms. The predominantly free-living ""turbellaria"" exhibited much shorter branches and faster-evolving mitogenomic architecture than parasitic Neodermata. As a result, ""parasitism"" had a strong explanatory power on the branch length variability (>90%), and there was a negative correlation between GORR and branch length. However, the stem branch of Neodermata comprised 63.6% of the total average branch length. This evolutionary period was also marked by a high rate of gene order rearrangements in the ancestral Neodermata. We discuss how this period of rapid evolution deep in the evolutionary history may have decoupled sequence evolution rates from longevity and GORR, and overestimated the explanatory power of ""parasitism"". This study shows that impacts of variables often vary across lineages, and stresses the importance accounting for the episodic nature of evolutionary patterns in studies of mitogenomic evolution.",39095653
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Host range of a parasitoid wasp is linked to host susceptibility to its mutualistic viral symbiont.,"Parasitoid wasps are one of the most species-rich groups of animals on Earth, due to their ability to successfully develop as parasites of nearly all types of insects. Unlike most known parasitoid wasps that specialize towards one or a few host species, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is a generalist that can survive within multiple genera of tephritid fruit fly hosts, including many globally important pest species. Diachasmimorpha longicaudata has therefore been widely released to suppress pest populations as part of biological control efforts in tropical and subtropical agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the role of a mutualistic poxvirus in shaping the host range of D. longicaudata across three genera of agricultural pest species: two of which are permissive hosts for D. longicaudata parasitism and one that is a nonpermissive host. We found that permissive hosts Ceratitis capitata and Bactrocera dorsalis were highly susceptible to manual virus injection, displaying rapid virus replication and abundant fly mortality. However, the nonpermissive host Zeugodacus cucurbitae largely overcame virus infection, exhibiting substantially lower mortality and no virus replication. Investigation of transcriptional dynamics during virus infection demonstrated hindered viral gene expression and limited changes in fly gene expression within the nonpermissive host compared with the permissive species, indicating that the host range of the viral symbiont may influence the host range of D. longicaudata wasps. These findings also reveal that viral symbiont activity may be a major contributor to the success of D. longicaudata as a generalist parasitoid species and a globally successful biological control agent.",39080979

To address this, we advance techniques for gland cell isolation and transcriptional analysis to define a stringent annotation of putative effectors for the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii at three key life-stages. We define 717 effector gene loci: 269 ""known"" high-confidence homologs of plant-parasitic nematode effectors, and 448 ""novel"" effectors with high gland cell expression. In doing so we define the most comprehensive ""effectorome"" of a plant-parasitic nematode to date.

These two species differed from <i>A. besseyi</i> in the shape of their tail terminus: bifurcate in <i>A. bicaudatus</i>; mucronate with a ventral thin mucro in <i>A. rutgersi</i>; and stellate in <i>A. besseyi</i>. One population each of these species was used for morphological and molecular analyses after being reared on <i>Monilinia fructicola</i>. Body and tail length differences were observed among Florida <i>A. bicaudatus</i> and other populations from the Far East and South Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of the rRNA gene sequences showed that Florida <i>A. bicaudatus</i> grouped with those of species from South Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands and several other populations listed as <i>Aphelenchoides</i> sp. from Brazil, Costa Rica, and Japan, which were considered as representatives of <i>A. bicaudatus</i> in this study. Similarly, sequences of Florida <i>A. rutgersi</i> grouped with those from environmental samples in Japan and North Carolina, which were listed as <i>Aphelenchoides</i> sp. and were considered as representatives of <i>A. rutgersi</i> in this study. Photosynthetic strawberry leaf samples were free from both <i>A. bicaudatus</i> and <i>A. rutgersi</i>, indicating that these two species did not damage strawberry. They were associated with desiccated leaves and/or propagative stolons, usually infected by fungi, confirming that they are mycetophagous under field conditions in this study. Results of soybean leaf inoculation on moist filter paper containing <i>A. bicaudatus</i> specimens showed that this species could become phytophagous under artificial conditions.

We evaluated the impact of the presence of CETP on infection by <i>Leishmania (L.) amazonensis</i> in an experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis using C57BL6/J mice transgenic for human CETP (CETP), having as control their littermates that do not express the protein, wild-type (WT) mice. The progression of the lesion after infection in the footpad was monitored for 12 weeks. Two groups of animals were formed to collect the plantar pad in the 4th and 12th week post-infection. The lesion increased from the 3rd week onwards, in both groups, with a gradual decrease from the 10th week onwards in the CETP group compared to the WT group, showing a reduction in parasitism and an improvement in the healing process, a reduction in CD68+ cells, and an increase in CD163+ and CD206, characterizing a population of M2 macrophages. A reduction in ARG1+ cells and an increase in INOS+ cells were observed. During infection, the LP profile showed an increase in triglycerides in the VLDL fraction in the CETP group at 12 weeks. Gene expression revealed a decrease in the CD36 receptor in the CETP group at 12 weeks, correlating with healing and parasite reduction. <i>In vitro</i>, macrophages derived from bone marrow cells from CETP mice showed lower parasite load at 48 h and, a reduction in arginase activity at 4 h accompanied by increased NO production at 4 and 24 h compared to WT macrophages, corroborating the in vivo findings.

Understanding the interaction between parasites, host, and their microbiome is crucial for management of helminth infection. This study intricately explores the interactions between microbial communities in Kashmir Merino sheep infected with H. contortus, to understand the complex interplay between host, parasite, and their microbiome.

Two high-quality genomes of the heterotrophic algae <i>Prototheca zopfii</i> Pz20 and Pz23 were obtained using short- and long-read genomic as well as transcriptomic data. The genome sizes were 31.2 Mb and 31.3 Mb, respectively, and contig N50 values of 1.99 Mb and 1.26 Mb. Although <i>P. zopfii</i> maintained its plastid genome, the transition to heterotrophy led to a reduction in both plastid and nuclear genome size, including the loss of photosynthesis-related genes from both the nuclear and plastid genomes and the elimination of genes encoding for carotenoid oxygenase and pheophorbide an oxygenase. The loss of genes, including basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked oxidase, and helicase, could have played a role in the transmission of autotrophy to heterotrophs and in the processes of abiotic stress resistance and pathogenicity. A total of 66 (1.37%) and 73 (1.49%) genes were identified as potential horizontal gene transfer events in the two <i>P. zopfii</i> genomes, respectively. Genes for malate synthase and isocitrate lyase, which are horizontally transferred from bacteria, may play a pivotal role in carbon and nitrogen metabolism as well as the pathogenicity of <i>Prototheca</i> and non-photosynthetic organisms. The two high-quality <i>P. zopfii</i> genomes provide new insights into their evolution as obligate heterotrophs and pathogenicity. The genus <i>Prototheca</i>, characterized by its heterotrophic nature and pathogenicity, serves as an exemplary model for investigating pathobiology.

The high level of genetic and biological diversity among parasites dictates an equally high level of diversity in the transition to parasitism. We previously hypothesized that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) played an important role in the evolution of parasitism among early ancestors of Trichinella, mediated by an interplay of ecological and evolutionary pathways that contributed to persistence and diversification. We propose that host selection may have been associated with the metabolism of ammonia and engender a new paradigm whereby the reprogrammed nurse cell is capable of generating cyanate thereby enabling the importance of the Trichinella cyanase in the longevity of the cell. Parasites and parasitism have revealed considerable resilience against a backdrop of climate change and environmental perturbation. Here we provide a putative link between key periods in the evolution of Trichinella and major geological and climatological events dating back 500 million years. A useful lens for exploring such ideas, the Stockholm Paradigm, integrates Ecological Fitting (a foundation for host colonization and diversification), the Oscillation Hypothesis (recurring shifts between trends in generalization and specialization relative to host range), the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution (microevolutionary co-adaptive processes), and the Taxon Pulse Hypothesis (alternating events of biotic expansion i.e., exploitation in evolutionary and ecological time).

Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, causes huge yield losses worldwide. Neuromotor function in M. incognita governed by 19 neuropeptides is vital for parasitism and parasite biology. The present study establishes the utility of Mi-flp14 for managing M. incognita in eggplant in continuation of our earlier proof of concept in tobacco (US patent US2015/0361445A1). Mi-flp14 hairpin RNA construct was used for generating 19 independent transgenic eggplant events. PCR and Southern hybridization analysis confirmed transgene integration and its orientation, while RT-qPCR and Northern hybridization established the generation of dsRNA and siRNA of Mi-flp14. In vitro and in vivo bio-efficacy analysis of single-copy events against M. incognita showed reduced nematode penetration and development at various intervals that negatively impacted reproduction. Interestingly, M. incognita preferred wild-type plants over the transgenics even when unbiased equal opportunity was provided for the infection. A significant reduction in disease parameters was observed in transgenic plants viz., galls (40-48%), females (40-50%), egg masses (35-40%), eggs/egg mass (50-55%), and derived multiplication factor (60-65%) compared to wild type. A unique demonstration of perturbed expression of Mi-flp14 in partially penetrated juveniles and female nematodes established successful host-mediated RNAi both at the time of penetration even before the nematodes started withdrawing plant nutrients and later stage, respectively. The absence of off-target effects in transgenic plants was supported by the normal growth phenotype of the plants and T-DNA integration loci. Stability in the bio-efficacy against M. incognita across T<sub>1</sub>- to T<sub>4</sub>-generation transgenic plants established the utility of silencing Mi-flp14 for nematode management.

These behaviors are known as extended phenotypes because they favor parasitic gene propagation. Here, we studied three lineages of Ophiocordyceps, a fungus that infects ants, altering their conduct before death. According to fungal strategy, ants may die in leaf litter, with entwined legs in branches, under the moss mat, or biting plant tissue. It is critical for parasites that the corpses stay at these places becauseOphiocordycepsexhibit iteroparity, possibly releasing spores in multiple life cycles. Thus, we assumed substrate cadaver permanence as a fungi reproductive proxy and corpse height as a proxy of cadaver removal. We hypothesize that biting vegetation and dying in higher places may increase the permanence of ant corpses while avoiding possible corpse predation on the forest floor. We monitored over a year more than 4000 zombie ants in approximately 15 km<sup>2</sup> of undisturbed tropical forest in central Amazonia. Our results show a longer permanence of corpses with increasing ground height, suggesting that the parasites may have better chances of releasing spores and infecting new hosts at these places. We found that the zombie ants that last longer on the substrate die under the moss mat in tree trunks, not necessarily biting vegetation. The biting behavior appears to be the most derived and complex mechanism amongOphiocordycepssyndromes.

In this study, we define the secondary metabolism of <i>Escovopsis</i> and closely related genera, symbionts in the gardens of fungus-farming ants. We ask how the gain and loss of various biosynthetic pathways correspond to divergent lifestyles. Long-read sequencing allowed us to define the chromosomal features of representative <i>Escovopsis</i> strains, revealing highly reduced genomes composed of seven to eight chromosomes. The genomes are highly syntenic with macrosynteny decreasing with increasing phylogenetic distance, while maintaining a high degree of mesosynteny. An ancestral state reconstruction analysis of biosynthetic pathways revealed that, while many secondary metabolites are shared with non-ant-associated <i>Sordariomycetes</i>, 56 pathways are unique to the symbiotic genera. Reflecting adaptation to diverging ant agricultural systems, we observe that the stepwise acquisition of these pathways mirrors the ecological radiations of attine ants and the dynamic recruitment and replacement of their fungal cultivars. As different clades encode characteristic combinations of biosynthetic gene clusters, these delineating profiles provide important insights into the possible mechanisms underlying specificity between these symbionts and their fungal hosts.

To elucidate the immune response mechanism of C. nasus livers to Anisakidae infection, we collected and analysed 18 parasitic and 18 non-parasitic livers at gonadal developmental stages II, III, and V using histopathology, molecular biology and transcriptome methods. The hepatic portal area of the parasitic group exhibited an increase in the fibrous stroma and thickened hepatic arteries with positive Ly-6G staining, indicating inflammation and immune responses in the liver. Hepatocyte cytokine levels and the expression of liver function-related genes indicated that fish livers responded similarly to Anisakidae parasitism across different gonadal developmental stages. Oxidative stress indices showed more intense changes in stage II samples, whereas gene expression levels of Nrf2 and C3 were significantly increased in parasitised livers during stage III and V. Liver transcriptome sequencing identified 2575 differentially expressed genes between the parasitic and non-parasitic groups at the three gonadal developmental stages. KEGG pathway analysis showed that natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and other immune pathways were significantly enriched. Expression patterns varied across developmental stages, suggesting that innate immunity was primarily responsible for the liver immune response to Anisakidae infection during C. nasus migration, possibly related to water temperature changes or shifts in the gonadal developmental stage. In summary, this study investigated the immune response of C. nasus to Anisakidae parasitism under natural conditions, focusing on reproductive aspects and environmental changes, thereby establishing a foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response of Anisakidae in C. nasus.",38897035

This study investigated whether the rice 13-lipoxygense gene <i>OsRCI-1</i> is involved in GLV production and plant defense in rice. The overexpression of <i>OsRCI-1</i> (<i>oeRCI</i> lines) in rice resulted in increased wound-induced levels of two prominent GLVs, <i>cis</i>-3-hexen-1-ol and <i>cis</i>-3-hexenal. In a previous study, we found that the overexpression of <i>OsRCI-1</i> reduced the colonization by the rice brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>) but increased the attractiveness to the egg parasitoid <i>Anagrus nilaparvatae</i> compared to wild-type (WT) plants. This study found that when <i>cis</i>-3-hexen-1-ol, but not <i>cis</i>-3-hexenal, was added to WT plants, it could change the BPH's colonization preference, i.e., more BPHs preferred to colonize the <i>oeRCI</i> lines. The exogenous application of <i>cis</i>-3-hexen-1-ol or <i>cis</i>-3-hexenal to BPH-infested WT plants could weaken or overturn the preference of <i>A. nilaparvatae</i> for <i>oeRCI</i> lines. However, field experiments revealed that only <i>cis</i>-3-hexenal was attractive to the parasitoid and increased the parasitism rates of BPH eggs.

Plant PG inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) disengage pathogen PGs, impairing infection. The soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, obligate root parasite produces secretions, generating a multinucleate nurse cell called a syncytium, a byproduct of the merged cytoplasm of 200-250 root cells, occurring through cell wall maceration. The common cytoplasmic pool, surrounded by an intact plasma membrane, provides a source from which H. glycines derives nourishment but without killing the parasitized cell during a susceptible reaction. The syncytium is also the site of a naturally-occurring defense response that happens in specific G. max genotypes. Transcriptomic analyses of RNA isolated from the syncytium undergoing the process of defense have identified that one of the 11G. max PGIPs, GmPGIP11, is expressed during defense. Functional transgenic analyses show roots undergoing GmPGIP11 overexpression (OE) experience an increase in its relative transcript abundance (RTA) as compared to the ribosomal protein 21 (GmRPS21) control, leading to a decrease in H. glycines parasitism as compared to the overexpression control. The GmPGIP11 undergoing RNAi experiences a decrease in its RTA as compared to the GmRPS21 control with transgenic roots experiencing an increase in H. glycines parasitism as compared to the RNAi control. Pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) and effector triggered immunity (ETI) components are shown to influence GmPGIP11 expression while numerous agricultural crops are shown to have homologs.",38875777

Among the six isolates isolated from the rhizosphere of lettuce, the isolate HZA84 demonstrated a high activity in its antagonism towards Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in vitro, and produces siderophore. By amplification of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-), and RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) genes, the isolate HZA84 was identified as Trichoderma asperellum, which was confirmed by analysis of phylogenetic tree. The Scanning electron microscope monitoring detected that the isolate HZA84 spread over the sclerotial surface, thus, damaging, decomposing, and distorting the globular cells of the outer cortex of the sclerotia. The Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis disclosed the overexpression of two genes (chit33 and chit37) encoding the endochitinase in addition to one gene (prb1) encoding the proteinase during 4 and 8days of the parasitism behavior of isolate HZA84 on the sclerotia surface. These enzymes aligned together in the sclerotia destruction by hyperparasitism. On the other hand, the pots trial revealed that spraying of isolate HZA84 reduced the drop disease symptoms of lettuce. The disease severity was decreased by 19.33 and the biocontrol efficiency was increased by 80.67% within the fourth week of inoculation.

Phylogenetic analyses using this new genomic information consistently place these fish-infecting apicomplexans, hereby informally named ichthyocolids, sister to the corallicolids within Coccidia. The apicoplast genome did not contain chlorophyll biosynthesis genes, providing evidence for another independent loss of this pathway within Apicomplexa. Based on the 16S rRNA gene found in the apicoplast, this group corresponds to the previously described ARL-VI.

Even though this behavior has significant ecological implications for the dynamics of several species, little is known about the molecular pathways associated with cleptoparasitism. To shed some light on this issue, we used gene expression data to perform a comparative analysis between two solitary neotropical bees: Coelioxoides waltheriae, an obligate parasite, and their specific host Tetrapedia diversipes. We found that ortholog genes involved in signal transduction, sensory perception, learning, and memory formation were differentially expressed between the cleptoparasite and the host.

To unravel the genomic basis of this coevolution from the host's perspective, we collected ants of the host species Temnothorax longispinosus, parasitized by the social parasite Temnothorax americanus, from 10 populations in the northeastern United States exhibiting varying levels of parasite prevalence and living under different climatic conditions. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with both prevalence and climate. Our investigation highlighted a multitude of candidate SNPs associated with parasite prevalence, particularly in genes responsible for sensory perception of smell including odorant receptor genes. We further focused on population-specific compositions of cuticular hydrocarbons, a complex trait important for signalling, communication and protection against desiccation. The relative abundances of n-alkanes were correlated with climate, while there was only a trend between parasite prevalence and the relative abundances of known recognition cues. Furthermore, we identified candidate genes likely involved in the synthesis and recognition of specific hydrocarbons. In addition, we analysed the population-level gene expression in the antennae, the primary organ for odorant reception, and established a strong correlation with parasite prevalence.

Dense granule proteins (GRAs) are thought to play an important role in the mediation of host-parasite interactions and facilitating parasitism. However, a large number of potential GRAs remain uncharacterized, and the functions of most of the identified GRAs have not been elucidated. Previously, we screened a large number GRAs including NcGRA27 and NcGRA61 using the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) technique. Here, we identified a novel GRA protein NcGRA85 and used C-terminal endogenous gene tagging to determine its localization at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in the tachyzoite. We successfully disrupted three gra genes (NcGRA27, NcGRA61 and NcGRA85) of N. caninum NC1 strain using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homologous recombination and phenotyped the single knockout strain. The NcGRA61 and NcGRA85 genes were not essential for parasite replication and growth in vitro and for virulence during infection of mice, as observed by replication assays, plaque assays and in vitro virulence assays in mice. Deletion of the NcGRA27 gene in the NC1 strain reduced the in vitro replication and growth of the parasite, as well as the pathogenicity of the NC1 strain in mice. In summary, our findings provide a basis for in-depth studies of N. caninum pathogenesis and demonstrate the importance of NcGRA27 in parasite growth and virulence, most likely a new virulence factor of N. caninum.",38768697

Ongoing work has suggested that similar mechanisms may modulate the reductive evolution of the two organelles in a given species, but quantitative data and statistical analyses exploring this picture remain limited outside of some specific cases like parasitism. Here, we use cross-eukaryote organelle genome data to explore evidence for coevolution of mitochondrial and plastid genome reduction. Controlling for differences between clades and pseudoreplication due to relatedness, we find that extents of mtDNA and ptDNA gene retention are related to each other across taxa, in a generally positive correlation that appears to differ quantitatively across eukaryotes, for example, between algal and nonalgal species.

In this study, phylogeny-oriented comparative analyses were conducted to investigate whether obligate Loranthaceae stem-parasites experienced higher degrees of plastome degradation than closely related facultative root-parasites and to explore the potential evolutionary events that triggered the 'domino effect' in plastome degradation of hemiparasitic plants. Through phylogeny-oriented comparative analyses, the results indicate that Loranthaceae hemiparasites have undergone varying degrees of plastome degradation as they evolved towards a heterotrophic lifestyle. Compared to closely related facultative root-parasites, all obligate stem-parasites exhibited an elevated degree plastome degradation, characterized by increased downsizing, gene loss, and pseudogenization, thereby providing empirical evidence supporting the theoretical expectation that evolution from facultative parasitism to obligate parasitism may result in a higher degree of plastome degradation in hemiparasites. Along with infra-familial divergence in Loranthaceae, several lineage-specific gene loss/pseudogenization events occurred at deep nodes, whereas further independent gene loss/pseudogenization events were observed in shallow branches. The findings suggest that in addition to the increasing levels of nutritional reliance on host plants, cladogenesis can be considered as another pivotal evolutionary event triggering the 'domino effect' in plastome degradation of hemiparasitic plants.

They are increasingly being recognized as widespread and important in marine environments, causing large annual losses in invertebrate aquaculture. Despite their importance, little molecular data of Ascetosporea exist, with only two genome assemblies published to date. Accordingly, the evolutionary origin of these parasites is unclear, including their phylogenetic position and the genomic adaptations that accompanied the transition from a free-living lifestyle to parasitism. Here, we sequenced and assembled three new ascetosporean genomes, as well as the genome of a closely related amphizoic species, to investigate the phylogeny, origin, and genomic adaptations to parasitism in Ascetosporea. Using a phylogenomic approach, we confirm the monophyly of Ascetosporea and show that Paramyxida group with Mikrocytida, with Haplosporida being sister to both groups. We report that the genomes of these parasites are relatively small (12-36Mb) and gene-sparse (~2300-5200 genes), while containing surprisingly high amounts of non-coding sequence (~70-90% of the genomes). Performing gene-tree aware ancestral reconstruction of gene families, we demonstrate extensive gene losses at the origin of parasitism in Ascetosporea, primarily of metabolic functions, and little gene gain except on terminal branches. Finally, we highlight some functional gene classes that have undergone expansions during evolution of the group. We present important new genomic information from a lineage of enigmatic but important parasites of invertebrates and illuminate some of the genomic innovations accompanying the evolutionary transition to parasitism in this lineage.

Despite the release of many draft genomes of parasitic plants, the genome evolution related to the parasitism feature of facultative parasites remains largely unknown. In this study, we present a high-quality chromosomal-level genome assembly for the facultative parasite Pedicularis kansuensis (Orobanchaceae), which invades both legume and grass host species in degraded grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This species has the largest genome size compared with other parasitic species, and expansions of long terminal repeat retrotransposons accounting for 62.37% of the assembly greatly contributed to the genome size expansion of this species. A total of 42,782 genes were annotated, and the patterns of gene loss in P. kansuensis differed from other parasitic species. We also found many mobile mRNAs between P. kansuensis and one of its host species, but these mobile mRNAs could not compensate for the functional losses of missing genes in P. kansuensis. In addition, we identified nine horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events from rosids and monocots, as well as one single-gene duplication events from HGT genes, which differ distinctly from that of other parasitic species. Furthermore, we found evidence for HGT through transferring genomic fragments from phylogenetically remote host species.

Therefore, this study focuses on estimating the frequency and transmission dynamics of several parasitic species, including Blastocystis, Giardia, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia spp. and hookworms, within a rural community in southwest Colombia with a particular emphasis on the One Health framework, considering environmental and zoonotic transmission potentials. This study involved the analysis of 125 samples, encompassing human participants (n=99), their domestic pets (dogs) (n=24) and water sources (n=2). Parasite detection was carried out utilizing a combination of microscopy and molecular techniques. Furthermore, the characterization of Blastocystis subtypes (STs) was achieved through Oxford Nanopore sequencing of the rRNA-18S gene. The investigation also entailed the examination of potential associations between intestinal parasitism and various sociodemographic factors. Results revealed a high frequency of parasitic infections when employing molecular methods, with Blastocystis (n=109/87%), Giardia (n=20/16%), Ancylostoma duodenale (n=28/22%), Ancylostoma ceylanicum (n=7/5.6%), E. histolytica (n=6/4.8%), Cryptosporidium spp. (n=12/9.6%) and even Taenia (n=1/0.8%) detected. Cryptosporidium spp. was also identified in water samples. Coinfections were prevalent, with 57% (n=70) of samples exhibiting single-parasite infections and 43% (n=53) showing various degrees of polyparasitism, emphasizing the complexity of transmission dynamics. Blastocystis subtyping, conducted via Oxford Nanopore sequencing, revealed a diversity of subtypes and coexistence patterns, with ST2 being the most prevalent. This research underscores the importance of using molecular techniques for frequency estimation, particularly emphasizing the relevance of zoonotic transmission in parasitic infections.

Commonly used plastics, polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) incubated in wastewater effluent, river water, estuarine water, and in the seawater for 16 weeks, were analysed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Within one week, plastic-colonizing communities shifted from wastewater effluent-associated microorganisms to marine taxa, some members of which (e.g. Oleibacter-Thalassolituus and Sphingomonas spp., on PET, Alcanivoracaceae on PET and PP, or Oleiphilaceae, on all polymers), were selectively enriched from levels undetectable in the starting communities. Remarkably, microbial biofilms were also susceptible to parasitism, with Saprospiraceae feeding on biofilms at late colonisation stages (from week 6 onwards), while Bdellovibrionaceae were prominently present on HDPE from week 2 and LDPE from day 1. Relative AMR gene abundance declined over time, and plastics did not become enriched for key AMR genes after wastewater exposure.

However, there is currently no available information on the transcriptome of faba bean responding to O. foetida parasitism. In this study, we employed RNA sequencing to explore the global gene expression changes associated with compatible and incompatible V. faba/O. foetida interactions. In this perspective, two faba bean varieties (susceptible and resistant) were examined at the root level across three stages of O. foetida development (Before Germination (BG), After Germination (AG) and Tubercule Stage (TS)). Our analyses presented an exploration of the transcriptomic profile, including comprehensive assessments of differential gene expression and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. Specifically, we investigated key pathways revealing the complexity of molecular responses to O. foetida attack. In this study, we detected differential gene expression of pathways associated with secondary metabolites: flavonoids, auxin, thiamine, and jasmonic acid. To enhance our understanding of the global changes in V. faba response to O. foetida, we specifically examined WRKY genes known to play a role in plant host-parasitic plant interactions. Furthermore, considering the pivotal role of parasitic plant seed germination in this interaction, we investigated genes involved in the orobanchol biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, we detected the gene expression of VuCYP722C homolog, coding for a key enzyme involved in orobanchol biosynthesis, exclusively in the susceptible host.

It has two morphologically indistinguishable pathotypes (or physiological races): banana and citrus pathotypes. At present, the only reliable method to differentiate the two pathotypes is testing the infestation and parasitism of nematodes on Citrus spp. via inoculation. However, differences in inoculation methods and conditions adopted by different researchers complicate obtaining consistent results. In this study, the parasitism and pathogenicity of 10 R. similis populations on rough lemon (Citrus limon) seedlings and the tropism and invasion of rough lemon roots were tested. It revealed that populations SWK, GJ, FZ, GZ, DBSR, and YJ were citrus pathotypes, which showed parasitism and pathogenicity on rough lemon and could invade rough lemon roots, whereas populations XIN, ML, HN6, and HL were banana pathotypes, having no parasitism and pathogenicity on rough lemon and they did not invade the rough lemon roots. Four pectate lyase genes (Rs-pel-2, Rs-pel-3, Rs-pel-4, and Rs-pel-5) belonging to the Class III family from these populations were amplified and analysed. The gene Rs-pel-3 could be amplified from six citrus pathotype populations and was stably expressed in the four developmental stages of the nematode, whereas it could not be amplified from the four banana pathotypes. Rs-pel-3 expression may be related to the parasitism and pathogenicity of R. similis on rough lemon. Hence, it can be used as a molecular marker to distinguish between banana and citrus pathotypes and as a target gene for the molecular identification of these two pathotypes. KEY POINTS:  Four pectate lyase genes (Rs-pels) from Radopholus similis were cloned and analysed.  The expression of Rs-pels is different in two pathotypes of Radopholus similis.

It is important to study the parasitism mechanism of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> to control its harm. In this experiment, the <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> HY13M and TE9M from Tacheng Prefecture and Hami City in Xinjiang, respectively, were used to analyze the parasitical mechanism of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> by means of transcriptome and proteome analyses. The parasitic capacity of TE9M was significantly stronger than that of HY13M in <i>Citrullus lanatus</i>. The results showed that the DEGs and DEPs were prominently enriched in the cell wall metabolism pathways, including ""cell wall organization or biogenesis"", ""cell wall organization"", and ""cell wall"". Moreover, the functions of the pectinesterase enzyme gene (<i>TR138070_c0_g</i>), which is involved in the cell wall metabolism of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> in its parasitism, were studied by means HIGS. The number and weight of <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> were significantly reduced when <i>TR138070_c0_g1</i>, which encodes a cell-wall-degrading protease, was silenced, indicating that it positively regulates <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> parasitism. Thus, these results suggest that the cell wall metabolism pathway is involved in <i>P. aegyptiaca</i> differentiation of the parasitic ability and that the <i>TR138070_c0_g1</i> gene plays an important role in <i>P. aegyptiaca</i>'s parasitism.",38592861
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Comparative secretome analysis of StrigaandCuscuta species identifies candidate virulence factors for two evolutionarily independent parasitic plant lineages.,"Many parasitic plants of the genera Striga and Cuscuta inflict huge agricultural damage worldwide. To form and maintain a connection with a host plant, parasitic plants deploy virulence factors (VFs) that interact with host biology. They possess a secretome that represents the complement of proteins secreted from cells and like other plant parasites such as fungi, bacteria or nematodes, some secreted proteins represent VFs crucial to successful host colonisation. Understanding the genome-wide complement of putative secreted proteins from parasitic plants, and their expression during host invasion, will advance understanding of virulence mechanisms used by parasitic plants to suppress/evade host immune responses and to establish and maintain a parasite-host interaction. We conducted a comparative analysis of the secretomes of root (Striga spp.) and shoot (Cuscuta spp.) parasitic plants, to enable prediction of candidate VFs. Using orthogroup clustering and protein domain analyses we identified gene families/functional annotations common to both Striga and Cuscuta species that were not present in their closest non-parasitic relatives (e.g. strictosidine synthase like enzymes), or specific to either the Striga or Cuscuta secretomes. For example, Striga secretomes were strongly associated with 'PAR1' protein domains. These were rare in the Cuscuta secretomes but an abundance of 'GMC oxidoreductase' domains were found, that were not present in the Striga secretomes. We then conducted transcriptional profiling of genes encoding putatively secreted proteins for the most agriculturally damaging root parasitic weed of cereals, S. hermonthica. A significant portion of the Striga-specific secretome set was differentially expressed during parasitism, which we probed further to identify genes following a 'wave-like' expression pattern peaking in the early penetration stage of infection. We identified 39 genes encoding putative VFs with functions such as cell wall modification, immune suppression, protease, kinase, or peroxidase activities, that are excellent candidates for future functional studies. Our study represents a comprehensive secretome analysis among parasitic plants and revealed both similarities and differences in candidate VFs between Striga and Cuscuta species. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new management strategies and delaying the evolution of virulence in parasitic weeds.",38582844

This parasitism damages the intestinal mucosal barrier, initiating a systemic immune and inflammatory response that jeopardizes the sustainable growth of rabbit farming. To understand the implications of infection on the host's immune and metabolic responses, we employed RNA-Seq to analyze RNA from the liver and duodenum tissues of post-infected rabbits infected with both the precocious line and wild-type strain of E.media. Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis revealed that the two parasites exhibit divergent transcriptomic imprints on host tissues. While the precocious line predominantly modulates immune-centric pathways with significant differential gene enrichment, wild-type strain favors pathways that affect metabolism. In addition, our study pinpointed a set of genes that undergo significant modifications in response to these effects. These revelations grant a fresh avenue to probe deeper into the symbiotic intricacies of the E.media and its rabbit host.",38570360
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Histone Acetylation Enhancing Host Melanization in Response to Parasitism by an Endoparasitoid Wasp.,"Endoparasitoids are insects that develop within other insects, employing unique strategies to enhance their offspring's survival. They inject polydnavirus and/or venom into their hosts along with eggs, effectively suppressing the host's immune system. Polydnavirus from Braconidae and Ichneumonidae wasps can integrate into the host's genome to express viral genes using the host's transcription systems. However, the ability of parasitoids without polydnavirus to manipulate host gene expression remains unclear. Lysine acetylation (LysAc), a post-translational modification critical for gene regulation, is hypothesized to be used by endoparasitoids lacking polydnavirus. We utilized the Chalcidoidea wasp <i>Tetrastichus brontispae</i>, which lacks polydnavirus, as an idiobiont endoparasitoid model to test this hypothesis, with pupae of the nipa palm hispid beetle <i>Octodonta nipae</i> as the host. Parasitism by <i>T. brontispae</i> resulted in the reduced expression of histone deacetylase Rpd3 and elevated levels of LysAc modification at histones H3.3K9 and H3.3K14 through proteomics and LysAc modification omics. The knockdown of Rpd3 increased the expression level of OnPPAF1 and OnPPO involved in the phenoloxidase cascade, leading to melanization in the host body whereby it resembled a mummified parasitized pupa and ultimately causing pupa death. This study enhances our understanding of how endoparasitoids employ histone acetylation to regulate immunity-related genes, offering valuable insights into their survival strategies.",38535357

Despite providing effective control of ASW soon after release, M. hyperodae parasitism rates have since declined significantly, with ASW hypothesised to have evolved resistance to its biocontrol agent. While the parasitism arsenal of M. hyperodae has previously been investigated, revealing many venom components and an exogenous novel DNA virus Microctonus hyperodae filamentous virus (MhFV), the effects of said arsenal on gene expression in ASW during parasitism have not been examined. In this study, we performed a multi-species transcriptomic analysis to investigate the biology of ASW parasitism by M. hyperodae, as well as the decline in efficacy of this biocontrol system. The transcriptomic response of ASW to parasitism by M. hyperodae involves modulation of the weevil's innate immune system, flight muscle components, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The multispecies approach also revealed continued expression of venom components in parasitised ASW, as well as the transmission of MhFV to weevils during parasitism and some interrupted parasitism attempts. Transcriptomics did not detect a clear indication of parasitoid avoidance or other mechanisms to explain biocontrol decline. This study has expanded our understanding of interactions between M. hyperodae and ASW in a biocontrol system of critical importance to Aotearoa-New Zealand's agricultural economy. Transmission of MhFV to ASW during successful and interrupted parasitism attempts may link to a premature mortality phenomenon in ASW, hypothesised to be a result of a toxin-antitoxin system. Further research into MhFV and its potential role in ASW premature mortality is required to explore whether manipulation of this viral infection has the potential to increase biocontrol efficacy in future.",38532315

In the present study, we performed a functional characterization of a ribosomal protein from R. microplus to investigate its importance in blood feeding, egg production and viability. Ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) is part of the 40S subunit, associated with 18S rRNA, and has been previously pointed to have a secondary role in different organisms. Rhipicephalus microplus RPS18 (RmRPS18) gene expression levels were modulated in female salivary glands during blood feeding. Moreover, mRNA levels in this tissue were 10 times higher than those in the midgut of fully engorged female ticks. Additionally, recombinant RmRPS18 was recognized by IgG antibodies from sera of cattle naturally or experimentally infested with ticks. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the RmRPS18 gene was performed in fully engorged females, leading to a significant (29 %) decrease in egg production. Additionally, egg hatching was completely impaired, suggesting that no viable eggs were produced by the RmRPS18-silenced group. Furthermore, antimicrobial assays revealed inhibitory activities against gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, affecting bacterial growth. Data presented here show the important role of RmRPS18 in tick physiology and suggest that RmRPS18 can be a potential target for the development of novel strategies for tick control.",38522220
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",A root-knot nematode effector targets the Arabidopsis cysteine protease RD21A for degradation to suppress plant defense and promote parasitism.,"Meloidogyne incognita is one of the most widely distributed plant-parasitic nematodes and causes severe economic losses annually. The parasite produces effector proteins that play essential roles in successful parasitism. Here, we identified one such effector named MiCE108, which is exclusively expressed within the nematode subventral esophageal gland cells and is upregulated in the early parasitic stage of M. incognita. A yeast signal sequence trap assay showed that MiCE108 contains a functional signal peptide for secretion. Virus-induced gene silencing of MiCE108 impaired the parasitism of M. incognita in Nicotiana benthamiana. The ectopic expression of MiCE108 in Arabidopsis suppressed the deposition of callose, the generation of reactive oxygen species, and the expression of marker genes for bacterial flagellin epitope flg22-triggered immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to M. incognita, Botrytis cinerea, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The MiCE108 protein physically associates with the plant defense protease RD21A and promotes its degradation via the endosomal-dependent pathway, or 26S proteasome. Consistent with this, knockout of RD21A compromises the innate immunity of Arabidopsis and increases its susceptibility to a broad range of pathogens, including M. incognita, strongly indicating a role in defense against this nematode. Together, our data suggest that M. incognita deploys the effector MiCE108 to target Arabidopsis cysteine protease RD21A and affect its stability, thereby suppressing plant innate immunity and facilitating parasitism.",38516730

In this review, we examine the status and potential of technologies that exploit genetic variation in host resistance to tackle this problem. We argue that there is an urgent need to improve understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved, leading to the development of tools that can be applied to boost host resistance and reduce the disease burden. We draw on two pressing global disease problems as case studies-sea lice infestations in salmonids and white spot syndrome in shrimp. We review how the latest genetic technologies can be capitalised upon to determine the mechanisms underlying inter- and intra-species variation in pathogen/parasite resistance, and how the derived knowledge could be applied to boost disease resistance using selective breeding, gene editing and/or with targeted feed treatments and vaccines. Gene editing brings novel opportunities, but also implementation and dissemination challenges, and necessitates new protocols to integrate the technology into aquaculture breeding programmes. There is also an ongoing need to minimise risks of disease agents evolving to overcome genetic improvements to host resistance, and insights from epidemiological and evolutionary models of pathogen infestation in wild and cultured host populations are explored. Ethical issues around the different approaches for achieving genetic resistance are discussed. Application of genetic technologies and approaches has potential to improve fundamental knowledge of mechanisms affecting genetic resistance and provide effective pathways for implementation that could lead to more resistant aquaculture stocks, transforming global aquaculture.",38504717

The Pacific Ocean (PO), one of the world's largest oligotrophic regions, remains largely unexplored in terms of the biogeography and biodiversity of microeukaryotes based on large-scale sampling. We investigated the horizontal distribution of microeukaryotes along a 16,000 km transect from the west to the east of the PO. The alpha diversity indices showed a distinct decreasing trend from west to east, which was highly correlated with water temperature. The microeukaryotic community, which was clustered into the western, central, and eastern PO groups, displayed a significant distance-decay relationship. Syndiniales, a lineage of parasitic dinoflagellates, was ubiquitously distributed along the transect and dominated the community in terms of both sequence and zero-radius operational taxonomic unit (ZOTU) proportions. The prevailing dominance of Syndiniales-affiliated ZOTUs and their close associations with dinoflagellates, diatoms, and radiolarians, as revealed by SparCC correlation analysis, suggested that parasitism may be an important trophic strategy in the surface waters of the PO. Geographical distance and temperature were the most important environmental factors that significantly correlated with community structure. Overall, our study sheds more light on the distribution pattern of both alpha and beta diversities of microeukaryotic communities and highlighted the importance of parasitisms by Syndiniales across the tropical PO.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the biogeographical and biodiversity patterns of microeukaryotic communities is essential to comprehending their roles in biogeochemical cycling. In this study, planktonic microeukaryotes were collected along a west-to-east Pacific Ocean transect (ca. 16,000 km). Our study revealed that the alpha diversity indices were highly correlated with water temperature, and the microeukaryotic communities displayed a distinct geographical distance-driven pattern. The predominance of the parasitic dinoflagellate lineage Syndiniales and their close relationship with other microeukaryotic groups suggest that parasitism may be a crucial survival strategy for microeukaryotes in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Potential of different species of actinobacteria in the management of Meloidogyne javanica.,"Root-knot nematodes (RKN) are one of the most harmful soil-borne plant pathogens in the world. Actinobacteria are known phytopathogen control agents. The aim of this study was to select soil actinobacteria with control potential against the RKN (Meloidogyne javanica) in tomato plants and to determine mechanisms of action. Ten isolates were tested and a significant reduction was observed in the number of M. javanica eggs, and galls 46days after infestation with the nematode. The results could be explained by the combination of different mechanisms including parasitism and induction of plant defense response. The M. javanica eggs were parasited by all isolates tested. Some isolates reduced the penetration of juveniles into the roots. Other isolates using the split-root method were able to induce systemic defenses in tomato plants. The 4L isolate was selected for analysis of the expression of the plant defense genes TomLoxA, ACCO, PR1, and RBOH1. In plants treated with 4L isolate and M. javanica, there was a significant increase in the number of TomLoxA and ACCO gene transcripts. In plants treated only with M. javanica, only the expression of the RBOH1 and PR1 genes was induced in the first hours after infection. The isolates were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Streptomyces sp. (1A, 3F, 4L, 6O, 8S, 9T, and 10U), Kribbella sp. (5N), Kitasatospora sp. (2AE), and Lentzea sp. (7P). The efficacy of isolates from the Kitasatospora, Kribbella, and Lentzea genera was reported for the first time, and the efficacy of Streptomyces genus isolates for controlling M. javanica was confirmed. All the isolates tested in this study were efficient against RKN. This study provides the opportunity to investigate bacterial genera that have not yet been explored in the control of M. javanica in tomatoes and other crops.",38483595
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Genetic factors underlying host resistance to Rhipicephalus microplus tick infestation in Braford cattle: a systems biology perspective.,"Approximately 80% of the world's cattle are raised in regions with a high risk of tick-borne diseases, resulting in significant economic losses due to parasitism by Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. However, the lack of a systemic biology approach hampers a comprehensive understanding of tick-host interactions that mediate tick resistance phenotypes. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2933 Braford cattle and found 340 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tick counts. Gene expression analyses were performed on skin samples obtained from previously tick-exposed heifers with extremely high or low estimated breeding values for R. microplus counts. Evaluations were performed both before and after artificial infestation with ticks. Differentially expressed genes were found within 1-Mb windows centered at significant SNPs from GWAS. A total of 330 genes were related to the breakdown of homeostasis that was induced by larval attachment to bovine skin. Enrichment analysis pointed to a key role of proteolysis and signal transduction via JAK/STAT, NFKB and WNT/beta catenin signaling pathways. Integrative analysis on matrixEQTL revealed two cis-eQTLs and four significant SNPs in the genes peptidyl arginine deiminase type IV (PADI4) and LOC11449251.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Role of Syndiniales parasites in depth-specific networks and carbon flux in the oligotrophic ocean.,"Microbial associations that result in phytoplankton mortality are important for carbon transport in the ocean. This includes parasitism, which in microbial food webs is dominated by the marine alveolate group, Syndiniales. Parasites are expected to contribute to carbon recycling via host lysis; however, knowledge on host dynamics and correlation to carbon export remain unclear and limit the inclusion of parasitism in biogeochemical models. We analyzed a 4-year 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding dataset (2016-19), performing network analysis for 12 discrete depths (1-1000m) to determine Syndiniales-host associations in the seasonally oligotrophic Sargasso Sea. Analogous water column and sediment trap data were included to define environmental drivers of Syndiniales and their correlation with particulate carbon flux (150m). Syndiniales accounted for 48-74% of network edges, most often associated with Dinophyceae and Arthropoda (mainly copepods) at the surface and Rhizaria (Polycystinea, Acantharea, and RAD-B) in the aphotic zone. Syndiniales were the only eukaryote group to be significantly (and negatively) correlated with particulate carbon flux, indicating their contribution to flux attenuation via remineralization. Examination of Syndiniales amplicons revealed a range of depth patterns, including specific ecological niches and vertical connection among a subset (19%) of the community, the latter implying sinking of parasites (infected hosts or spores) on particles.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Subtelomeric plasticity contributes to gene family expansion in the human parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni.,"The genomic region that lies between the telomere and chromosome body, termed the subtelomere, is heterochromatic, repeat-rich, and frequently undergoes rearrangement. Within this region, large-scale structural changes enable gene diversification, and, as such, large multicopy gene families are often found at the subtelomere. In some parasites, genes associated with proliferation, invasion, and survival are often found in these regions, where they benefit from the subtelomere's highly plastic, rapidly changing nature. The increasing availability of complete (or near complete) parasite genomes provides an opportunity to investigate these typically poorly defined and overlooked genomic regions and potentially reveal relevant gene families necessary for the parasite's lifestyle. Using the latest chromosome-scale genome assembly and hallmark repeat richness observed at chromosome termini, we have identified and characterised the subtelomeres of Schistosoma mansoni, a metazoan parasitic flatworm that infects over 250 million people worldwide. Approximately 12% of the S. mansoni genome is classified as subtelomeric, and, in line with other organisms, we find these regions to be gene-poor but rich in transposable elements. We find that S. mansoni subtelomeres have undergone extensive interchromosomal recombination and that these sites disproportionately contribute to the 2.3% of the genome derived from segmental duplications. This recombination has led to the expansion of subtelomeric gene clusters containing 103 genes, including the immunomodulatory annexins and other gene families with unknown roles. The largest of these is a 49-copy plexin domain-containing protein cluster, exclusively expressed in the tegument-the tissue located at the host-parasite physical interface-of intramolluscan life stages. We propose that subtelomeric regions act as a genomic playground for trial-and-error of gene duplication and subsequent divergence. Owing to the importance of subtelomeric genes in other parasites, gene families implicated in this subtelomeric expansion within S. mansoni warrant further characterisation for a potential role in parasitism.",38413905

Intracellular infection is a hallmark of the agent <i>Brucella</i> and a primary cause of distress, through which the bacterium regulates the host intracellular environment to promote its own colonization and replication, evading host immunity and pharmaceutical killing. Current studies of <i>Brucella</i> intracellular processes are typically premised on bacterial phenotype such as intracellular bacterial survival, followed by biochemical or molecular biological approaches to reveal detailed mechanisms. While such processes can deepen the understanding of <i>Brucella</i>-host interaction, the insights into host alterations in infection would be easily restricted to known pathways. In the current study, we applied CRISPR Cas9 screen to identify host genes that are most affected by <i>Brucella</i> infection on cell viability at the genomic level. As a result of CRISPR screening, we firstly identified that knockout of the negatively selected genes <i>GOLGA6L6</i>, <i>DEFB103B</i>, <i>OR4F29</i>, and <i>ERCC6</i> attenuate the viability of both the host cells and intracellular <i>Brucella</i>, suggesting these genes to be potential therapeutic targets for <i>Brucella</i> control. In particular, knockout of <i>DEFB103B</i> diminished <i>Brucella</i> intracellular survival by altering host cell autophagy. Conversely, knockout of positive screening genes promoted intracellular proliferation of <i>Brucella</i>.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",A Critical Appraisal of DNA Transfer from Plants to Parasitic Cyst Nematodes.,"Plant-parasitic nematodes are one of the most economically important pests of crops. It is widely accepted that horizontal gene transfer-the natural acquisition of foreign genes in parasitic nematodes-contributes to parasitism. However, an apparent paradox has emerged from horizontal gene transfer analyses: On the one hand, distantly related organisms with very dissimilar genetic structures (i.e. bacteria), and only transient interactions with nematodes as far as we know, dominate the list of putative donors, while on the other hand, considerably more closely related organisms (i.e. the host plant), with similar genetic structure (i.e. introns) and documented long-term associations with nematodes, are rare among the list of putative donors. Given that these nematodes ingest cytoplasm from a living plant cell for several weeks, there seems to be a conspicuous absence of plant-derived cases. Here, we used comparative genomic approaches to evaluate possible plant-derived horizontal gene transfer events in plant parasitic nematodes. Our evidence supports a cautionary message for plant-derived horizontal gene transfer cases in the sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii. We propose a 4-step model for horizontal gene transfer from plant to parasite in order to evaluate why the absence of plant-derived horizontal gene transfer cases is observed. We find that the plant genome is mobilized by the nematode during infection, but that uptake of the said ""mobilome"" is the first major barrier to horizontal gene transfer from host to nematode.

These nematodes use multiple strategies to infect their host and to establish a successful parasitism inside the host such as cell-wall degradation enzymes, inhibition of host defense proteins, and molecular mimicry. In the present study, the main parasitism-associated gene families were identified and compared between the migratory and sedentary endoparasitic nematodes. The results showed that the migratory and sedentary endoparasitic nematodes share a core conserved parasitism mechanism established throughout the evolution of parasitism. However, genes involved in pectin degradation and hydrolase activity are rapidly evolving in the migratory endoparasitic nematodes. Additionally, cell-wall degrading enzymes such as GH45 cellulases and pectate lyase and peptidase and peptidase inhibitors were expanded in the migratory endoparasitic nematodes. The molecular mimicry mechanism was another key finding that differs between the endoparasitic and sedentary parasitic nematodes. The PL22 gene family, which is believed to play a significant role in the molecular mechanisms of nematode parasitism, has been found to be present exclusively in migratory endoparasitic nematodes. Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that it was de novo born in these nematodes. This discovery sheds new light on the molecular evolution of these parasites and has significant implications for our understanding of their biology and pathogenicity.

Here, we characterised MgCRT1, a calreticulin protein of M. graminicola, and identified its target in the plant. In situ hybridisation showed MgCRT1 mRNA accumulating in the subventral oesophageal gland in J2 nematodes. Immunolocalization indicated MgCRT1 localises in the giant cells during parasitism. Host-induced gene silencing of MgCRT1 reduced the infection ability of M. graminicola, while over-expressing MgCRT1 enhanced rice susceptibility to M. graminicola. A yeast two-hybrid approach identified the calmodulin-like protein OsCML31 as an interactor of MgCRT1. OsCML31 interacts with the high mobility group protein OsHMGB1 which is a conserved DNA binding protein. Knockout of OsCML31 or overexpression of OsHMGB1 in rice results in enhanced susceptibility to M. graminicola. In contrast, overexpression of OsCML31 or knockout of OsHMGB1 in rice decreases susceptibility to M. graminicola. The GST-pulldown and luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that MgCRT1 decreases the interaction of OsCML31 and OsHMGB1 in a competitive manner. In conclusion, when M. graminicola infects rice and secretes MgCRT1 into rice, MgCRT1 interacts with OsCML31 and decreases the association of OsCML31 with OsHMGB1, resulting in the release of OsHMGB1 to enhance rice susceptibility.",38311858

However, we observed a horizontal transfer of a transposon and a striking parallel evolution in a set of gene families between the honey bee and the bee louse fly. Convergences included genes potentially involved in metabolism and immunity and the loss of nearly all bitter-tasting gustatory receptors, in agreement with life in a protective nest and a diet of honey, pollen, and beeswax. Vision and odorant receptor genes also exhibited rapid losses. Only genes whose orthologs in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster respond to honey bee pheromone components or floral aroma were retained, whereas the losses included orthologous receptors responsive to the anti-ovarian honey bee queen pheromones.

Adult females deposit the first-stage larvae directly onto wounds or natural body orifices (e.g., genitalia) of the host, from where they quickly colonize the host tissue and feed on it for development. The infestation of W. magnifica can lead to health issues, welfare concerns, and substantial economic losses. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the W. magnifica-causing myiasis. In this study, we collected parasitic-stage larvae of W. magnifica from wounds of naturally infested Bactrian camels, as well as pupae and adult flies reared in vitro from the wound-collected larvae, for investigating the gene expression profiles of the different developmental stages of W. magnifica, with a particular focus on examining gene families closely related to the parasitism of the wound-collected larvae. As key proteins related to the parasite-host interaction, 2049 excretory/secretory (ES) proteins were identified in W. magnifica through the integration of multiple bioinformatics approaches. Functional analysis indicates that these ES proteins are primarily involved in cuticle development, peptidase activity, immune response, and metabolic processes. The global investigation of gene expression at different developmental stages using pairwise comparisons and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed that the upregulated genes during second-stage larvae were related to cuticle development, peptidase activity, and RNA transcription and translation; during third-stage larvae to peptidase inhibitor activity and nutrient reservoir activity; during pupae to cell and tissue morphogenesis and cell and tissue development; and during adult flies to signal perception, many of them involved in light perception, and adult behavior, e.g., feeding, mating, and locomotion. Specifically, the expression level analysis of the likely parasitism-related genes in parasitic wound-collected larvae revealed a significant upregulation of 88 peptidase genes (including 47 serine peptidase genes), 110 cuticle protein genes, and 21 heat shock protein (hsp) genes. Interestingly, the expression of 2 antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including 1 defensin and 1 diptericin, was also upregulated in the parasitic larvae. We identified ES proteins in W. magnifica and investigated their functional distribution. In addition, gene expression profiles at different developmental stages of W. magnifica were examined. Specifically, we focused on gene families closely related to parasitism of wound-collected larvae. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the life cycle of the myiasis-causing fly, especially during the parasitic larval stages, and provide guidance for the development of control measures against W. magnifica.",38297211
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Effects of sublethal fipronil exposure on cross-generational functional responses and gene expression in Binodoxys communis.,"The effective systemic insecticide fipronil is widely used on a variety of crops and in public spaces to control insect pests. Binodoxys communis (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is the dominant natural enemy of Aphis gossypii Glover (Homoptera: Aphididae), an important cotton pest, and has good efficiency in inhibiting aphid populations. The direct effects of environmental residues of sublethal fipronil doses on adult B. communis have not previously been reported. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the side effects and transcriptomic impacts of sublethal fipronil doses on B. communis. The results showed that exposure to the LC<sub>10</sub> dose of fipronil significantly reduced the survival rate and parasitism rate of the F<sub>0</sub> generation, but did not affect these indicators in the F<sub>1</sub> generation. The LC<sub>25</sub> dose did not affect the survival or parasitic rates of the F<sub>0</sub> generation, but did significantly reduce the survival rate of F<sub>1</sub> generation parasitoids. These results indicated that sublethal doses of fipronil affected B. communis population growth. Transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in B. communis at 1h after treatment were primarily enriched in pathways associated with fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of fatty acids, and fatty acid metabolism. DEGs at 3days after treatment were mainly enriched in ribosomal functions, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and tyrosine metabolism. Six DEGs (PY, ELOVL, VLCOAR, MRJP1, ELOVL AAEL008004-like, and RPL13) were selected for validation with real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. This is the first report of sublethal, trans-generational, and transcriptomic side effects of fipronil on the dominant parasitoid of A. gossypii. The results of this study show that adaptation of parasitoids to high concentrations of pesticides may be at the expense of their offspring. These findings broaden our overall understanding of the intergenerational adjustments used by insects to respond to pesticide stress and call for risk assessments of the long-term impacts and intergenerational effects of other pesticides.",38296923
"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",The evolution of constitutively active humoral immune defenses in Drosophila populations under high parasite pressure.,"Both constitutive and inducible immune mechanisms are employed by hosts for defense against infection. Constitutive immunity allows for a faster response, but it comes with an associated cost that is always present. This trade-off between speed and fitness costs leads to the theoretical prediction that constitutive immunity will be favored where parasite exposure is frequent. We selected populations of Drosophila melanogaster under high parasite pressure from the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. With RNA sequencing, we found the evolution of resistance in these populations was associated with them developing constitutively active humoral immunity, mediated by the larval fat body. Furthermore, these evolved populations were also able to induce gene expression in response to infection to a greater level, which indicates an overall more activated humoral immune response to parasitization. The anti-parasitoid immune response also relies on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway being activated in muscles following infection, and this induced response was only seen in populations that had evolved under high parasite pressure. We found that the cytokine Upd3, which induces this JAK/STAT response, is being expressed by immature lamellocytes. Furthermore, these immune cells became constitutively present when populations evolved resistance, potentially explaining why they gained the ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling. Thus, under intense parasitism, populations evolved resistance by increasing both constitutive and induced immune defenses, and there is likely an interplay between these two forms of immunity.",38206983

Some reports suggest that these reptile ticks bite and attach to humans via accidental parasitism and transmit disease, with the tick Bothriocroton hydrosauri known to transmit Rickettsia honei or Flinders Island Spotted Fever Rickettsia to humans. This descriptive study aims to identify the ticks collected from wild reptiles submitted to veterinary clinics and captured by snake rescuers from New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and detect the presence of tick-borne bacterial DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella spp. and conventional nested-PCR to detect Borrelia spp. Morphological identification revealed ticks removed from one eastern blue-tongued lizard (Tiliqua scincoides scincoides) from North-Eastern NSW (Lismore), one eastern blue-tongued lizard from the Greater Sydney area (Canley Heights), one diamond python (Morelia spilota spilota) from the Greater Sydney area (Woronora Heights) and one red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus) from the Greater Sydney Area (Cronulla) in New South Wales were Amblyomma moreliae.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",- Invited Review - Chemical signalling within the rumen microbiome.,"Ruminants possess a specialized four-compartment forestomach, consisting of the reticulum, rumen, omasum, and abomasum. The rumen, the primary fermentative chamber, harbours a dynamic ecosystem comprising bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and bacteriophages. These microorganisms engage in diverse ecological interactions within the rumen microbiome, primarily benefiting the host animal by deriving energy from plant material breakdown. These interactions encompass symbiosis, such as mutualism and commensalism, as well as parasitism, predation, and competition. These ecological interactions are dependent on many factors, including the production of diverse molecules, such as those involved in quorum sensing (QS). QS is a density-dependent signalling mechanism involving the release of autoinducer (AIs) compounds, when cell density increases AIs bind to receptors causing the altered expression of certain genes. These AIs are classified as mainly being N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL; commonly used by Gram-negative bacteria) or autoinducer-2 based systems (AI-2; used by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria); although other less common AI systems exist. Most of our understanding of QS at a gene-level comes from pure culture in vitro studies using bacterial pathogens, with much being unknown on a commensal bacterial and ecosystem level, especially in the context of the rumen microbiome. A small number of studies have explored QS in the rumen using 'omic' technologies, revealing a prevalence of AI-2 QS systems among rumen bacteria. Nevertheless, the implications of these signalling systems on gene regulation, rumen ecology, and ruminant characteristics are largely uncharted territory. Metatranscriptome data tracking the colonization of perennial ryegrass by rumen microbes suggest that these chemicals may influence transitions in bacterial diversity during colonization. The likelihood of undiscovered chemicals within the rumen microbial arsenal is high, with the identified chemicals representing only the tip of the iceberg.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Strong mitonuclear discordance in the phylogeny of Neodermata and evolutionary rates of Polyopisthocotylea.,"The genomic evolution of Polyopisthocotylea remains poorly understood in comparison to the remaining three classes of Neodermata: Monopisthocotylea, Cestoda, and Trematoda. Moreover, the evolutionary sequence of major events in the phylogeny of Neodermata remains unresolved. Herein we sequenced the mitogenome and transcriptome of the polyopisthocotylean Diplorchis sp., and conducted comparative evolutionary analyses using nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomic datasets of Neodermata. We found strong mitonuclear discordance in the phylogeny of Neodermata. Polyopisthocotylea exhibited striking mitonuclear discordance in relative evolutionary rates: the fastest-evolving mtDNA in Neodermata and a comparatively slowly-evolving nDNA genome. This was largely attributable to its very long stem branch in mtDNA topologies, not exhibited by the nDNA data. We found indications that the fast evolution of mitochondrial genomes of Polyopisthocotylea may be driven both by relaxed purifying selection pressures and elevated levels of directional selection. We identified mitochondria-associated genes encoded in the nuclear genome: they exhibited unique evolutionary rates, but not correlated with the evolutionary rate of mtDNA, and there is no evidence for compensatory evolution (they evolved slower than the rest of the genome). Finally, there appears to exist an exceptionally large (6.3kb) nuclear mitochondrial DNA segment (numt) in the nuclear genome of newly sequenced Diplorchis sp. A 3'-end segment of the 16S rRNA gene encoded by the numt was expressed, suggesting that this gene acquired novel, regulatory functions after the transposition to the nuclear genome. In conclusion, Polyopisthocotylea appears to be the lineage with the fastest-evolving mtDNA sequences among all of Bilateria, but most of the substitutions were accumulated deep in the evolutionary history of this lineage.

Because <i>M. larici-populina</i> is a heteroecious obligate biotroph, its spread depends on its ability to carry out its reproductive cycle through larch and then poplar parasitism. Genomic approaches have identified more than 1,000 candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) from the predicted secretome of <i>M. larici-populina</i> that are potentially implicated in the infection process. In this study, we selected CSEP pairs (and one triplet) among CSEP gene families that share high sequence homology but display specific gene expression profiles among the two distinct hosts. We determined their subcellular localization by confocal microscopy through expression in the heterologous plant system <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Five out of nine showed partial or complete chloroplastic localization. We also screened for potential protein interactors from larch and poplar by yeast two-hybrid assays. One pair of CSEPs and the triplet shared common interactors, whereas the members of the two other pairs did not have common targets from either host. Finally, stromule induction quantification revealed that two pairs and the triplet of CSEPs induced stromules when transiently expressed in <i>N.benthamiana</i>. The use of <i>N.benthamiana eds1</i> and <i>nrg1</i> knockout lines showed that CSEPs can induce stromules through an <i>eds1</i>-independent mechanism.

In the case of intestinal parasites, interactions with the host intestinal flora are inevitable during the process of parasitism. We studied the role of T. canis in regulating the composition and diversity of the intestinal flora of the host by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and various bioinformatics analyses. The -diversity analysis showed that Toxocara canis infection resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance and diversity of host intestinal flora. The -diversity analysis showed that the intestinal flora of infected dogs was similar to that carried by T. canis. Analysis of the microflora composition and differences at the phylum level showed that the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) increased with T. canis infection. Analysis of species composition and differences at the genus level revealed that the proportion of some of the pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium sensu stricto and Staphylococcus, increased after T. canis infection.

Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated root transformation has been widely used in soybean for the functional validation of target genes in classical transgenesis and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) in CRISPR-based technologies. Initial data showed that in vitro hairy root induction from soybean cotyledons and hypocotyls were not the most suitable strategies for simultaneous performing genetic studies and nematode bioassays. Therefore, an ex vitro hairy root system was developed for in planta screening of target molecules during soybean parasitism by root-knot nematodes (RKNs). Applying this method, hairy roots were successfully induced by A. rhizogenes from petioles of detached soybeanleaves. The soybean GmPR10 and GmGST genes were then constitutively overexpressed in both soybean hairy roots and tobacco plants, showing a reduction in the number of Meloidogyne incognita-induced galls of up to 41% and 39%, respectively. In addition, this system was evaluated for upregulation of the endogenous GmExpA and GmExpLB genes by CRISPR/dCas9, showing high levels of gene activation and reductions in gall number of up to 58.7% and 67.4%, respectively. Furthermore, morphological and histological analyses of the gallsweresuccessfully performed. These collective data validate the ex vitro hairy root system for screening target genes, using classical overexpression and CRISPR approaches, directly in soybean in a simple manner and associated with nematode bioassays.

A total of 36 soil samples collected from two climatic regions were subjected to high-throughput ITS gene sequencing for fungal community analysis. In conjunction soil physicochemical properties were assessed and compared. Analyses included an examination of the relationship of fungal community structure to environmental factors and functional profiling of the community structure was using the FUNGuild pipeline. Our data revealed rich fungal diversity, with a total of 11 fungal phyla, 31 classes, 86 orders, 200 families, 388 genera, and 515 species identified in the soil samples. Distinct variations in the physicochemical properties of the soil and fungal community structure were seen in relation to climate and surface vegetation. Notably, despite a colder climate, the rhizosphere soil of Xinjiang exhibited higher fungal (-)diversity compared to the rhizosphere soil of Fujian. -diversity analyses indicated that soil heterogeneity and differences in fungal community structure were primarily influenced by spatial distance limitations and vegetation type. Furthermore, we identified dominant fungal phyla with significant roles in energy cycling and organic matter degradation, including members of the <i>Sordariomycetes</i>, <i>Leotiomycetes</i>, <i>Archaeosporomycetes</i>, and <i>Agaricomycetes</i>. Functional analyses of soil fungal communities highlighted distinct microbial ecological functions in Xinjiang and Fujian soils.

The diverse antigenicity of Ot genotypes and inter-strain differences in genome content are connected to varied virulence and clinical outcomes; however, detailed studies of strain-related pulmonary immune responses in human patients or small animal models of infection are lacking. In this study, we have used two clinically prevalent bacterial strains (Karp and Gilliam) to reveal cellular immune responses in inflamed lungs and potential biomarkers of disease severity. The results demonstrate that outbred CD-1 mice are highly susceptible to both Karp and Gilliam strains; however, C57BL/6 (B6) mice were susceptible to Karp, but resistant to Gilliam (with self-limiting infection), corresponding to their tissue bacterial burdens and lung pathological changes. Multicolor flow cytometric analyses of perfused B6 mouse lungs revealed robust and sustained influx and activation of innate immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells), followed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, during Karp infection, but such responses were greatly attenuated during Gilliam infection. The robust cellular responses in Karp-infected B6 mice positively correlated with significantly early and high levels of serum cytokine/chemokine protein levels (CXCL1, CCL2/3/5, and G-CSF), as well as pulmonary gene expression (Cxcl1/2, Ccl2/3/4, and Ifng). In vitro infection of B6 mouse-derived primary macrophages also revealed bacterial strain-dependent immune gene expression profiles.

In this review, I propose that coevolution be defined more broadly as ""reciprocal adaptive evolution at any level of biological organisation"". The classification of reciprocal evolution at all levels of biological organization as coevolution would maintain consistency in terminology. More importantly, the broader definition should facilitate greater integration of coevolution research across disciplines. For example, principles usually discussed only in the context of coevolution between species or coevolution between genes (e.g., tight and diffuse coevolution, and compensatory coevolution, respectively) could be more readily applied to new fields.

A category of serpin genes, named CvT-serpins, was discovered to be specifically expressed and secreted by the teratocytes of Cotesia vestalis, an endoparasitoid of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the C. vestalis serpin genes are duplicated and most of them are clustered into 1 monophyletic clade. Intense positive selection was detected at the residues around the P1-P1' cleavage sites of the Cv-serpin reactive center loop domain. Functional analyses revealed that, in addition to the conserved function of melanization inhibition (CvT-serpins 1, 16, 18, and 21), CvT-serpins exhibited novel functions, i.e. bacteriostasis (CvT-serpins 3 and 5) and nutrient metabolism regulation (CvT-serpins 8 and 10). When the host-parasitoid system is challenged with foreign bacteria, CvT-serpins act as an immune regulator to reprogram the host immune system through sustained inhibition of host melanization while simultaneously functioning as immune effectors to compensate for this suppression. In addition, we provided evidence that CvT-serpin8 and 10 participate in the regulation of host trehalose and lipid levels by affecting genes involved in these metabolic pathways. These findings illustrate an exquisite tactic by which parasitoids win out in the parasite-host evolutionary arms race by manipulating host immune and nutrition homeostasis via adaptive gene evolution and neofunctionalization.",38061001

However, the study of haemosporidian parasites in Ghana is still lacking. This study sought to assess the prevalence and diversity of Leucocytozoon parasites in domestic birds in Ghana. Blood samples were collected from domestic birds in Ghana's Bono and Eastern regions to screen for Leucocytozoon parasites. Thin blood smears were prepared for microscopy and DNA was extracted from whole blood kept in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes for PCR. Due to the large number of samples, real-time PCR was performed to amplify the conserved rDNA gene.

"""parasitism"" AND ""gene""",Effects of Deformed Wing Virus-Targeting dsRNA on Viral Loads in Bees Parasitised and Non-Parasitised by <i>Varroa destructor</i>.,"The <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a devastating parasite of honey bees; however the negative effects of varroa parasitism are exacerbated by its role as an efficient vector of the honey bee pathogen, Deformed wing virus (DWV). While no direct treatment for DWV infection is available for beekeepers to use on their hives, RNA interference (RNAi) has been widely explored as a possible biopesticide approach for a range of pests and pathogens. This study tested the effectiveness of three DWV-specific dsRNA sequences to lower DWV loads and symptoms in honey bees reared from larvae in laboratory mini-hives containing bees and varroa. The effects of DWV-dsRNA treatment on bees parasitised and non-parasitised by varroa mites during development were investigated. Additionally, the impact of DWV-dsRNA on viral loads and gene expression in brood-parasitising mites was assessed using RNA-sequencing. Bees parasitised during development had significantly higher DWV levels compared to non-parasitised bees. However, DWV-dsRNA did not significantly reduce DWV loads or symptoms in mini-hive reared bees, possibly due to sequence divergence between the DWV variants present in bees and varroa and the specific DWV-dsRNA sequences used. Varroa mites from DWV-dsRNA treated mini-hives did not show evidence of an elevated RNAi response or significant difference in DWV levels. Overall, our findings show that RNAi is not always successful, and multiple factors including pathogen diversity and transmission route may impact its efficiency.",38005935

However, the molecular interactions between hosts and dipteran parasitoids have only partially been studied. Gene expression analysis by reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is indispensable to characterise their interactions. Accurate normalisation of RT-qPCR-based gene expression requires the use of reference genes that are constantly expressed irrespective of experimental conditions.

We assessed the ability of the exoS<sup>+</sup><sub>Sm</sub> gene, encoding a sensor protein from the plant endosymbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti to substitute its orthologous bvrS in the related animal/human pathogen Brucella abortus. ExoS phosphorylated the B. abortus regulator BvrR in vitro and in cultured bacteria, showing conserved biological function. Production of ExoS in a B. abortus bvrS mutant reestablished replication in host cells and the capacity to infect mice. Bacterial outer membrane properties, the production of the type IV secretion system VirB, and its transcriptional regulators VjbR and BvrR were restored as compared to parental B. abortus. These results indicate that conserved traits of orthologous TCS from bacteria living in and sensing different environments are sufficient to achieve phenotypic plasticity and support bacterial survival.

Chickpea roots establish symbiotic relationships with soil microorganisms, resulting in the formation of root nodules essential for biological nitrogen fixation. In this study, 20 chickpea genotypes were selected from a genome-wide association panel to assess nodulation traits under eight different treatment combinations involving biofertilizers (<i>Rhizobium</i>, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza - VAM) and inorganic fertilizers (NPK) using a randomized block design with three replications. Pre-planting soil preparation included the application of fertilizers and biofertilizers. Comprehensive analyses including descriptive statistics, correlation, path analysis, principal component analysis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and gene expression studies were conducted. Among treatments, the NPK+<i>Rhizobium</i> combination significantly enhanced nodulation across genotypes, while the <i>Rhizobium</i>+VAM (T7) treatment identified ICC-9085 as a superior donor for the number of nodules, aiming for sustainable chickpea productivity. Gene expression profiling through qRT-PCR revealed that the RZ+VAM treatment notably upregulated several key genes, including CaNFP, GST, Leghemoglobin, Nodulin6, and CaLYK3, with CaNFP emerging as a pivotal regulator of nodulation. The marked upregulation of CaNFP underlines its potential as a target for enhancing symbiotic efficiency. The availability of the chickpea draft genome opens new avenues for employing genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas systems. Targeted editing of the CaNFP gene offers a promising strategy to improve nodule formation, nitrogen fixation, and overall plant vigor.

Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense, two primary commercial truffle species in China, were selected to colonize Pinus armandii and Carya illinoinensis in a two-and-a-half-year symbiosis experiment. Host performances, including growth, nutrient uptake, and physiological characteristics, were dynamically monitored. The molecular response of host leaf to Tuber symbiosis was further analyzed using RNA-seq.Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense exhibited superior colonization of P. armandii compared to that of C. illinoinensis. Both Tuber species enhanced the performance of the two hosts by increasing their height, stem circumference, and biomass. Phosphorus levels and activities of peroxidase and catalase in hosts were observed to increase during Tuber symbiosis. The results confirmed that Tuber colonization led to significant alterations in leaf transcriptomic profiles of the two trees. Tuber indicum and T. panzhihuanense both elicited defense-related regulation in host leaves, such as secondary metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction, with distinct patterns in P. armandii and C. illinoinensis.

Recently, a SPARK receptor-like kinase (RLK)/receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) complex was shown to be essential for arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in both monocot and dicot plants. Here, we show that in Aeschynomene legumes, the RLCK component of this receptor complex has undergone a gene duplication event and mediates a unique nodule symbiosis that is independent of rhizobial Nod factors. In Aeschynomene evenia, AeRLCK2 is crucial for nodule initiation but not for arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. Additionally, AeRLCK2 physically interacts with and is phosphorylated by the cysteine-rich RLK, AeCRK, which is also required for nodulation.

We analyzed bacterial community composition via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and evaluated key soil quality indicators. While inoculation with AM fungal consortia had minimal effects on most soil parameters, significant differences were observed between recovery stages. The 15Y recovery site exhibited improved soil structure, microbial activity, and aggregate stability compared to the 2Y site, highlighting the importance of long-term restoration. However, potential overlap in ecological roles among native microorganisms likely mitigates the impact of AMF inoculation. These findings suggest that AM fungal consortia alone may not drive immediate improvements in soil quality but can contribute to microbial interactions and recovery processes over time. This study highlights the complexity of soil restoration and emphasizes the need for strategies that integrate plant cover with microbial community development to enhance long-term ecosystem stability.

To identify such factors in poplar and its fungal associates, we mined existing and de novo tree and fungal transcriptional datasets. We identified co-expressed genes enabling ECM symbiosis at early and mature stages of the interaction. These sets of genes can be divided into general fungal-sensing and ECM-specific components. We highlight the importance of fungal modulation of plant JA-related defenses and the regulation of secretory pathways for ECM compatibility, including upregulation of key fungal small secreted proteins, the downregulation of plant secreted peroxidases, and the downregulation of plant cell wall remodeling proteins concomitantly with the upregulation of fungal glycosyl hydrolases acting on pectin. Not only gene regulation, but also its temporal scale and dynamics seem to play a crucial role for mycorrhizal compatibility.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",The involvement of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in modulating polyamine metabolism and low-temperature tolerance enhancement in white clover.,"Sustained low temperatures can prevent white clover (<i>Trifolium repens</i> L.) from overwintering and regreening, making it difficult to revive the plants in the spring. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widely known for their ability to enhance host stress tolerance. It is unclear whether AMF can enhance the low-temperature tolerance of white clover, which is associated with polyamines. The purpose of this study was to examine how inoculating white clover with an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> affected the biomass, leaf chlorophyll and gas exchange, levels of root polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine), activities of key polyamine-related enzymes, and the expression level of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (<i>TrSAMDC1</i>) gene at low temperatures (4C for four days). The low-temperature treatment inhibited the root mycorrhizal colonization rate. Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased shoot, root, and total biomass, with greater increases found at optimal temperatures (22C/18C, 16 h/8 h, day/night temperature) than at low temperatures. Similarly, AMF inoculation significantly improved leaf gas exchange parameters, with larger increases observed at optimal temperatures than at low temperatures. Low temperatures caused a considerable increase in putrescine and spermidine levels, while simultaneously decreasing spermine levels. Mycorrhizal inoculation elevated putrescine, spermidine, and spermine levels regardless of temperature conditions, along with a significant rise in the (spermidine+spermine)/putrescine ratio. Mycorrhizal plants also exhibited considerably increased activities of arginine decarboxylase and polyamine oxidase, but not ornithine decarboxylase, in response to low temperatures. Mycorrhizal inoculation, together with low temperatures, elevated <i>TrSAMDC1</i> expression. The observed alterations in mycorrhiza-mediated polyamines were primarily attributed to increased arginine decarboxylase activity and <i>TrSAMDC1</i> expression. This study demonstrated the role of mycorrhizal fungi in modulating polyamine metabolism and enhancing plant tolerance to low-temperature stress.",40612595

Here we studied members of the uncharacterized LYR-IB group, and found that they show high affinity for LCO, short- and long-chain CO, and play a complementary role with the LYR-IA receptors for AM establishment. While LYR-IB knock out mutants had a reduced AMF colonization in several species, constitutive/ectopic expression in wheat increased AMF colonization. LYR-IB function is conserved in all tested angiosperms, but in most japonica rice a deletion creates a frameshift in the gene, explaining differences in AM phenotypes between rice and other monocot single LYR-IA mutants. In conclusion, we identified a class of LysM-RLK receptors in angiosperms with unique biochemical properties and a role in both LCO and CO perception for AM establishment.",40593575

In a symbiotic relationship, AMF had the potential to enhance potassium absorption and storage in various tissues of bean seedlings. Under symbiotic conditions, the concentration of potassium in stem tissues was observed to increase almost four times more than control conditions. The genome of beans was shown to contain a total of nineteen PvAKT genes and two PvHKT genes. Based on phylogeny analysis, PvAKT family members and their corresponding orthologs were categorized into four distinct groups.

The presence of cis-regulatory element related to ABA responsiveness in the upstream region led to the division of PvAKT and PvHKT genes into two specific groups. Gene expression analysis disclosed that PvAKT and PvHKT genes are induced by AMF and have tissue specific expression.

Since the phylloxera crisis, cultivated grapevines are obtained by grafting a Vitis vinifera scion onto a rootstock. In this study, we investigated the responses of the rootstock ""Riparia Gloire de Montpellier"" to mycorrhizal root colonization under three distinct phosphate (P) levels. We explored regulatory aspects of plant P nutrition by comparing the transcriptome profiling of non-colonized roots and roots colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198. We have shown that P availability significantly influences gene expression in both the AM fungus and the grapevine. Our transcriptomic study shed light on the molecular mechanisms that prevail during the AM symbiosis of a perennial woody plant species, with available P affecting several functional classes of proteins.

Expression of two of the three identified AM-induced Pht1, VvPT4 and VvPT8, was enhanced under mycorrhizal conditions, but finely tuned by the P treatment. To immunolocalize VvPT4 and VvPT8, we developed an innovative root-clearing protocol specifically designed for woody plants.

However, comprehensive transcriptome analysis to reveal the molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in the symbiotic process between AMF and maize is still limited. In the potted plant experiment, maizes inoculated with and without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> were grown under well-watered (WW) or drought-stressed (DS) conditions. By using RNA-Seq and transcriptome analysis on maize roots and leaves, this work aimed to investigate the differential expressed genes (DEGs) related to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway induced by AMF symbiosis under drought stress. Our findings indicated that <i>F. mosseae</i> inoculation resulted in a decrease in the net fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while simultaneously elevating Ca<sup>2+</sup> contents in the maize roots and leaves under well-watered or drought-stressed conditions. Notably, 189 DEGs were regulated not only by AMF symbiosis and drought stress, but also exhibited preferential expression in either leaves or roots. The annotation and enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway genes, related to signal transduction, cellular process, and defense response. A high number of DEGs with this function (including calcineurin B-like protein (CBL), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) receptor kinases) were upregulated-DEGs or downregulated-DEGs in <i>F. mosseae</i>-inoculated maizes under drought stress. Furthermore, some DEGs belong to transcription factor (TF) families, including bHLH ERF, and, MYB, were speculated to play key roles in improving the drought tolerance of maize.

This study aims to evaluate the potential of DLB at optimal application rates in keeping plant (annual ryegrass) nutrition level while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving soil biological health compared to chemical fertilizers in an acidic soil under liming or not. Soil biological health index was assessed through quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing. The results showed that increasing DLB addition to 150kgN ha<sup>-1</sup> resulted in a similar N uptake of ryegrass to that under urea despite lower mineral N provided by DLB. This application rate decreased greenhouse gas emissions relative to urea, through decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> emission despite increased CH<sub>4</sub> emission.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Metabolic Shifts and Nutrient Transfer Patterns in Orchid Seeds During Symbiotic Germination.,"Symbiotic germination in orchids is a complex biological process driven by a unique dependence on mycorrhizal fungi. It is generally assumed that, due to a lack of endosperm, orchids fully rely on fungi for carbon sources. However, orchid seed embryos store substantial nutrient reserves, but the metabolic functions of these reserves and their roles in establishing symbiosis during germination remain unclear. Here, we used time-series transcriptomics and ultrastructural morphological analyses to investigate the early stages of symbiotic germination in Gymnadenia conopsea, a terrestrial orchid widely distributed across Eurasia. We identify three distinct phases during early seed germination (seed imbibition, fungal invasion and symbiotic establishment) that correspond with pronounced changes in gene expression and energy metabolism. During imbibition, lipid metabolism was already active, leading the oleosomes to fuse into large lipid vacuoles, whereas carbohydrate metabolism became dominant after fungal invasion, with lipid droplets appearing within fungal hyphae. Based on this transcriptomic and morphological evidence, we propose a potential model in which lipid vacuoles facilitate lipid transfer from the seeds to the fungi during the initial invasion, after which the fungi supply carbohydrates to the seeds for further development.",40369997
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Integrative transcriptomic and physiological analyses uncover mechanisms by which arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi mitigate salt stress in sugar beet.,"Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is cultivated extensively worldwide as an important cash crop, and soil salinity is a critical factor influencing both its yield and sugar content. Consequently, enhancing the salt tolerance of sugar beet is of paramount importance. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic associations with approximately 80% of vascular plants, thereby improving the adaptability of host plants to adverse conditions. However, the mechanisms by which the AM symbiosis assists sugar beet in coping with salt stress remain poorly understood. To investigate the adaptation strategies employed by AM symbiotic sugar beet under salt stress, we examined physiological and transcriptomic changes in sugar beet seedlings subjected to various treatments, using the KWS1176 variety as the experimental material. The results indicated that AM symbiotic sugar beet demonstrated superior performance under salt stress, characterized by improved seedling growth, alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities, modifications in osmoregulatory substance levels, reduced Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, and enhanced K<sup>+</sup> influx within the root system. Notably, most of the differentially expressed genes were implicated in pathways related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and phytohormone signal transduction. Furthermore, pivotal genes identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis were validated via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, revealing that the salt tolerance of AM symbiotic sugar beet may be associated with its ionic homeostasis, antioxidant enzyme activities, and regulation of photosynthesis at both transcriptional and physiological levels.",40293550

Lindl. (A. roxburghii) is an increasingly popular medicinal herb. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi, known for their symbiotic relationships with plant roots, enhance nutrient uptake and disease resistance in host plants. However, their specific regulatory mechanisms in A. roxburghii are not fully understood. In this study, Fujian A. roxburghii was inoculated with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices, and successful root colonization was observed. Following AM fungal colonization, there was a significant upregulation of photosynthesis-related genes in the stems, accompanied by improved canopy phenotypes and root architecture. Consequently, AM-inoculated plants exhibited increased fresh and dry biomass, as well as elevated levels of polysaccharides and flavonoids. Additionally, the incidence of Fusarium oxysporum-induced stalk rot was reduced in AM-inoculated plants. Analysis of defense-related enzymes indicated that AM-inoculated plants exhibited a rapid and robust response to pathogen infection, mitigating oxidative stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes associated ""Fatty acid degradation"", ""MAPK signaling pathway-plant"", and ""Plant-pathogen interaction"", suggesting their involvement in enhanced disease resistance. A regulatory network centered on ACX1 and calmodulin, involving multiple transcription factors such as WRKY, bHLH, ERF, NAC, and HSF, was implicated in defense responses. These findings demonstrated the beneficial effects of AM fungi on yield, quality, and disease resistance in A. roxburghii, providing a theoretical foundation for its cultivation and genetic improvement.",40220671
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",High mycorrhizal specificity in the monotypic mycoheterotrophic genus Relictithismia (Thismiaceae).,"Mycoheterotrophic plants, which depend entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for carbon acquisition, often exhibit high specificity toward their fungal partners. Members of Thismiaceae are generally recognized for their extreme mycorrhizal specialization and rarity. In this study, we examined the mycorrhizal associations of Relictithismia, a recently discovered monotypic genus within Thismiaceae, and Thismia abei, a Thismia species with a similar distribution in southern Japan, by employing high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. Our analyses revealed that both R. kimotsukiensis and T. abei are predominantly associated with two specific virtual taxa (VTX00295 and VTX00106) of the genus Rhizophagus (Glomeraceae). These shared associations may reflect either phylogenetic niche conservatism, in which the common ancestor of R. kimotsukiensis and T. abei retained the same AM fungal partners, or convergent evolution, in which the AM fungal phylotypes were independently recruited due to their potential benefits for these mycoheterotrophic plants. Furthermore, BLAST searches demonstrated that VTX00295 and VTX00106 are widely distributed globally, suggesting that highly specialized mycorrhizal interactions are unlikely to be the primary drivers of the limited distribution and rarity of R. kimotsukiensis and T. abei. Overall, our findings enhance our understanding of high mycorrhizal specificity in Thismiaceae. However, broader investigations, combining extensive sampling of Thismiaceae species with ancestral state reconstruction, are needed to determine whether the shared associations detected here reflect phylogenetic niche conservatism or convergent evolution.",40208340

Furthermore, to address the role of miRNA-mediated families in regulating plant hormone crosstalk during plant-microbe interactions, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), auxin (AUX) and 5 ethylene (ET). In this study, Expression levels of ethylene-responsive genes reflect antagonism between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ET, re-modulating immunoregulatory capacity in tomato. On the other hand, our data reinforce that overexpression of AP2 and ERF1 delay senescence in Fol-infected tomato plants by downregulating the expression level of SPL3. Moreover, a balance between TCP4, miR164, and miR319b transcript levels suggests that their interaction attenuates senescence under AMF infection. Measurements of phytohormone production under AMF/Fol infection at 30 days post-inoculation (dpi) showed significantly lower hormone production in the resistant genotype (Heinz 'Hz') compared to the susceptible genotype (Castle Rock 'CR') by 36, 17, and 14% for ET, ABA, and JA, respectively. These findings potentially imply that modifications in Heinz's hormonal signaling are prompting host changes, which lead to decreased phytohormone levels. This study provides an applied basis for further research on the molecular mechanism and challenges associated with the continuous cropping of tomato by R. irregulari under the deleterious effects of Fusarium on late stages of root infection.",40197894

In this study, we explored the role of the DoSWEET14 sugar transporter in Dendrobium officinale during OM symbiosis. Transcriptome sequencing revealed significant changes in gene expression in mycorrhizal roots, particularly the upregulation of DoSWEET14. Subcellular localization studies confirmed that DoSWEET14 is localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting its involvement in nutrient exchange between the orchid and OM fungi. Complementation assays using a yeast strain deficient in hexose transport demonstrated that DoSWEET14 has broad substrate specificity, efficiently transporting multiple monosaccharides. Additionally, overexpression of DoSWEET14 in Arabidopsis increased sugar content without affecting biomass, supporting its role in carbohydrate transport and storage during symbiosis. These findings suggest that DoSWEET14 plays a key role in regulating carbon allocation and stabilizing the mutualistic relationship between Dendrobium officinale and OM fungi.",40175892

Here, we investigate the genomic divergences between the available genome of O. maius Znand the genomes of metal tolerant and sensitive isolates of O. maius, with the aim of identifying genes or intergenic regions possibly involved in the display of the tolerance. The resequenced genomes of 8 tolerant and 10 sensitive isolates were mapped on the reference, O. maius Zn,yielding 357 gene models from the reference that were either missing or too polymorphic to be identified in the genomes of the sensitive isolates. These regions included genes with functions related to defense mechanisms and with unknown functions. One third of the predicted gene models turned out to be highly polymorphic, including many enriched GO terms, i.e. DNA/RNA metabolism and modification, chromosome/chromatin organization, protein biosynthesis, metabolism and function, energy consumption/transfer and mitochondrion.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",The C24-methyl/ethyl sterol ratio is increased by Rhizophagus irregularis colonization.,"Plant-microorganism interactions underlie many ecosystem roles, in particular the enhancement of plant nutrition through mutualistic relationships, such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis that affects a large proportion of land plants. The establishment of this interaction induces a wide range of signaling pathways in which lipids, and particularly sterols, may play a central role. However, their supported functions are poorly known. We performed a study on eleven model plants (banana, barrelclover, flax, grapevine, maize, pea, poplar, potato, rice,sorghum and tomato) to measure the sterol content and characterize the sterol composition of roots that were either non-colonized or colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal model Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198. Our results reveal a systematic increase in the content of C24-methyl sterols in crude extracts of colonized roots as compared to non-colonized roots. In addition, the transcripts of SMT1 and SMT2 (which encode enzymes that produce C24-methyl and C24-ethyl sterols, respectively) were differentially accumulated in colonized plant roots. No common regulation pattern was observed among plants. The phylogenetic relationship of members of the SMT1 and SMT2 families in more than 100 fully sequenced genomes of plants, ferns, mosses, algae and fungi has allowed the identification of unambiguous clades. Our results therefore highlight a conserved arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis-dependent regulation of the root sterol composition in angiosperms, with some plant specificities.",40072696

Molecular evidence has been widely used in phylogeny since the turn of the century and has contributed to the nomenclature of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Considering that some species were described solely from field collected spores which often are degraded, synonymy amongst described species is likely. Type and living cultures of Rhizophagus clarus and Rhizophagus manihotis, and protologue of Glomus zaozhuangianus were analyzed to compare spore wall structure. Sequences of the large subunit (LSU) of the rDNA gene of living isolates of Rhizophagus clarus and Rhizophagus manihotis also were used to test phylogenetic relationships. A comprehensive biogeography of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was used to investigate species distribution according to soil and climate factors. Spore wall structure analysis indicates that the three species are morphologically indistinguishable. Spore color, size, and shape all overlap highly among the three species. The spore wall of each is composed of an outer hyaline mucilaginous layer, a rigid hyaline laminated layer conferring a visible ""halo"" to mature spores, and a third rigid pigmented laminated layer that confers spore color. Phylogenetic analysis shows that living isolates identified as R. manihotis were nested with living isolates of R. clarus, forming a monophyletic clade with 99% bootstrap support. Spores of R. clarus (as amended here) have been recorded in six continents and 31 countries in 10 biogeographical realms. R. clarus was detected most often in soil pH 5.0-6.0, soil P up to 5mg/dm<sup>3</sup>, and soil organic matter up to 2.5%.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Ethylene promotes SMAX1 accumulation to inhibit arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis.,"Most land plants engage in arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis with Glomeromycotina fungi for better access to mineral nutrients. The plant hormone ethylene suppresses AM development, but a molecular explanation for this phenomenon is lacking. Here we show that ethylene inhibits the expression of many genes required for AM formation in Lotus japonicus. These genes include strigolactone biosynthesis genes, which are needed for fungal activation, and Common Symbiosis genes, which are required for fungal entry into the root. Application of strigolactone analogs and ectopic expression of the Common Symbiosis gene Calcium Calmodulin-dependent Kinase (CCaMK) counteracts the effect of ethylene. Therefore, ethylene likely inhibits AM development by suppressing expression of these genes rather than by inducing defense responses. These same genes are regulated by SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1), a transcriptional repressor that is proteolyzed during karrikin signaling. SMAX1 is required for suppression of AM by ethylene, and SMAX1 abundance in nuclei increases after ethylene application. We conclude that ethylene suppresses AM by promoting accumulation of SMAX1. SMAX1 emerges as a signaling hub that integrates karrikin and ethylene signaling, thereby orchestrating development of a major plant symbiosis with a plant's physiological state.",40016206

We sequenced the genomes of three MHB strains isolated from soil contaminated with PAHs and phenol. Moreover, experiments were carried out to check if these bacteria have ability to stimulate the growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and promote plant development. Phylogenomic analysis identified the strains as belonging to the Streptomyces, Pantoea, and Bacillus genera, all exhibiting high tolerance to hydrocarbons. Genome mining revealed genes encoding enzymes for the degradation of aromatic compounds, alongside biosynthetic gene clusters for secondary metabolites such as siderophores and antibiotics. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the studied MHB strains enhance AMF development and spore production while exhibiting plant growth-promoting mechanisms such as siderophore and ammonia production, phosphate solubilization, and cellulolytic enzyme synthesis.

We simulated aboveground invertebrate decline in grassland ecosystems with two levels of invertebrate biomass (36% and 100% of current ambient conditions), plus a control with no invertebrates present. Each standardised grassland mesocosm additionally contained one clonal Quercus robur L. sapling to investigate the extent of invertebrate decline effects exceeding grasslands. We investigated oak biomass partitioning and mycorrhiza formation, oak leaf transcriptome and microbiome composition of leaves, roots and rhizosphere. While invertebrate decline did not significantly affect oak performance and herbivory-related gene expression, fungal communities presented an increase of saprotrophs and pathogens, especially in leaves. Among leaf-inhabiting bacteria, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria increased under invertebrate decline. The belowground microbiome was only little affected. But, invertebrate decline came along with a reduced influence on predators leading to an elevated aphids infestation that proofed able to alter microbiota.

However, the currently known genomes of geoglossoid fungi encode fewer carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in Pezizomycotina, in contrast to the abundant CAZyme repertoires found in well-known ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. The absence of assembled genomes for cultured geoglossoid fungi hinders our understanding of the genomic features related to their lifestyles. We hypothesize that the genome of <i>Sarcoleotia globosa</i>, a putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungus, encodes abundant CAZymes, consistent with its culturability. General features, such as smaller genome size and smaller number of genes, are shared between the genome of <i>S. globosa</i> strain NBRC 116039 and other geoglossalean genomes. However, the former had the most extensive CAZyme repertoire, with several enzyme families involved in plant cell wall degradation. Some of these CAZymes are not found in Geoglossales and closely related lineages. Nonetheless, the number of CAZymes from <i>S. globosa</i> was notably smaller than that previously reported in ericoid mycorrhizal fungi.

Effector secreted by AM fungi influence symbiotic relationship by modifying host cells, suppressing host defense and promoting infection to derive nutrients from the host. Here, we conducted a reference-based transcriptome sequencing of Funneliformis mosseae BR221 to enhance understanding on the molecular machinery involved in the establishment of interaction between host and AM fungi. A total of 163 effector proteins were identified in F. mosseae isolate BR221, of these, 79.14% are extracellular effectors and 5.5% are predicted cytoplasmic effectors. In silico prediction using a pathogen-host interaction database suggested four of the 163 effectors could be crucial in establishing AM fungi-host interactions. Protein-protein docking analysis revealed interactions between these potential effectors and plant proteins known to be differentially expressed during mycorrhizal association, such as defensins, aquaporins, and PTO proteins. These interactions are multifaceted in modulating host physiological and defense mechanisms, including immune suppression, hydration, nutrient uptake, and oxidative stress modulation. These findings of the current study provide a foundational understanding of fungal-host molecular interactions and open avenues for exploring pathways influenced by these effectors. By deepening our knowledge of these mechanisms, the use of AM fungi in biofertilizer formulations can be refined by selecting strains with specific effectors that enhance nutrient uptake, improve drought and disease resistance, and tailor the fungi's symbiotic efficiency to different crops or environmental conditions, thus contributing to more targeted and sustainable agricultural practices.",39819563

Overexpression of sly-miR408b compromised mycorrhizal colonisation by Rhizophagus irregularis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots. A basic blue protein gene (SlBBP) was then identified as the new target gene of miR408b in tomato. The expression of membrane-located SlBBP was induced in a copper-dependent manner. Importantly, the loss function of SlBBP decreased the root mycorrhizal colonisation. Overexpression of SlBBP decreased SOD activity, which may interfere with the process of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutation of RBOH1, which encodes ROS-producing enzymes NADPH oxidases, obviously reduced the arbuscule abundance in the mutant roots.

In co-inoculation experiment, Scots pine seedlings were pre-inoculated with mutualistic beneficial fungus (Suillus luteus) prior to H. annosum infection. The result revealed that inoculation with beneficial fungus promoted plant root growth. Transcriptome analyses revealed that co-inoculated plants and plants inoculated with beneficial fungus shared some similarities in defense gene responses.

Jasmonic acid (JA) signalling is one of the major regulators that decides the fate of these interactions in plants. However, the role of JA is not unanimous and varies from neutral to positive or negative regulation. In the present study, we targeted SlCOI1, a key gene in JA signalling, by silencing (using artificial miRNA approach) and overexpressing constitutively in tomato transgenic hairy roots (HR) system. We developed in-vitro colonisation of these hairy roots with model arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis. The colonised HR exhibited a stronger induction of PAMPs-triggered immunity (PTI) response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL). The ROS signalling key gene RBOH-B and the PTI response marker genes LRR22 and PTI5 were expressed at an earlier stage and at a higher amplitude in the colonised HR, providing evidence for mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR). Further, SlCOI1 silencing resulted in a higher degree of R. irregularis colonisation, while overexpression restricted its proliferation. Intriguingly, despite a higher degree of colonisation, the SlCOI1-silenced HR lines manifested a weakened MIR compared to its control colonised HR line. This univocally indicates an indispensable role of COI1-mediated JA signalling in MIR.

We investigated the relationship between mycorrhiza levels and PVY levels in potato leaves and roots. We found accumulation of the virus in the leaves of mycorrhizal plants, but our studies additionally showed a reduced PVY content in potato roots colonized by AMF, which has not been previously demonstrated.

Multiple components involved in the autoregulation of mycorrhiza (AOM) have been recently identified from several plant species; however, the mechanisms underlying the feedback regulation of AM symbiosis remain largely unknown. Here, we report that AM colonization promotes the flavonol biosynthesis pathway in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and an AM-specific UDP-glucosyltransferase SlUGT132, which probably has the flavonol glycosylation activity, negatively regulates AM development. SlUGT132 was predominantly expressed in the arbuscule-containing cells, and its knockout or knockdown mutants showed increased soluble sugar content, root colonization level and arbuscule formation. Conversely, overexpression of SlUGT132 resulted in declined soluble sugar content and mycorrhization degree. Metabolomic assay revealed decreased contents of astragalin, tiliroside and cynaroside in slugt132 mycorrhizal roots, but increased accumulation of these flavonoid glycosides in SlUGT132-overexpressing plant roots.

According to the log2foldchange-value and adjP-value, we integrated the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in maize (Zea mays L.) treated with BR and AM, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants deficient in BR receptors, and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants inoculated with AM fungi. In addition, we characterized the symbiotic performance of tomato plants with BR receptor defects and overexpression. The results indicated that the common differential genes induced by BR and AM were involved in metabolic processes, such as cell wall modification, cytoskeleton remodeling, auxin and ethylene signaling, photosynthesis, mineral nutrient transport, and stress defense. Specifically, these include the BR1 gene, which modifies the cell wall. However, the fungal colonization rate of BR receptor-deficient tomato plants was significantly reduced, and the total phosphorus concentration was increased. Conversely, the performance of the overexpressing tomato transformation plants demonstrated a significant contrast. Additionally, the mild rescue of mycorrhizal attenuation in mutants treated with exogenous BR suggests the possibility of direct feedback from BR synthesis to AM. Notably, the cell wall modification gene (SlBR1) and calcium spike gene (SlIPD3) were induced by both BR and AM, suggesting that BR may influence cell penetration during the early stages of AM colonization.

In non-mycorrhizal roots, drought led to a drop in PIP abundance, followed by a transient increase under rewatering, whereas leaves showed an opposite pattern. In contrast, mycorrhiza contributed to maintenance of high and stable levels of PIPs in both plant organs after an initial increase, prolonged over the irrigation period. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis resolved up to 13 aquaporin complexes with highly reproducible pl positions across leaf and root samples, symbiotic and non-symbiotic, stressed or not. Mass spectrometry recognized in leaves and roots a different ratio of PIP1 and PIP2 subunits within 2D spots that accumulated the most. Regardless of symbiotic status, drought regulation of aquaporins in roots was manifested as the prevalence of complexes that comprise almost exclusively PIP2 monomers. In contrast, the leaf response involved enrichment in PIP1s. PIP1s are thought to enhance water transport, facilitate CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion but also affect stomatal movements. These features, together with elevated aquaporin levels, might explain a stress tolerance mechanism observed in mycorrhizal plants, resulting in faster recovery of stomatal water conductance and CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate after drought.",39289494

We identified the <i>HcZnT2</i> gene from the ECM fungus <i>Hebeloma cylindrosporum</i>, encoding a member of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family including Zn transporters, and analyzed its transcriptional regulation, the transport function by yeast complementation experiments, and its subcellular localization using a GFP fusion protein in yeast. <i>HcZnT2</i> is highly induced during mycorrhization of <i>Pinus pinaster</i>, and upregulated in presence of the host plant root even without any direct contact. However, <i>HcZnT2</i> is repressed by Zn excess conditions. By functional expression in yeast, our results strongly support the ability of HcZnT2 to transport Zn and, to a lesser extent, manganese. HcZnT2 localization was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast. Mycorrhizal gene activation at low external Zn suggests that the Zn transporter HcZnT2 might be important for the early establishment of the ECM symbiosis during Zn deficiency, rather than under Zn excess.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungus <i>S. bovista</i> on the growth and development of hazel roots and gene expression changes through comparative transcriptome analysis. After inoculation with <i>S. bovista</i>, the fungus symbiotically formed ectomycorrhiza with hazel roots. The fresh weights of the aboveground and underground parts of My treatment (inoculated with S. bovista and formed mycorrhiza) were much higher than those of the control, respectively.

In the paired comparison, 3,265 upregulated and 1,916 downregulated genes were identified. The most significantly enriched Gene Ontology term for the upregulated Differentially Expressed Genes was GO:0005215 (transporter activity). Immunohistochemical analysis suggested that the expression levels of auxin and Auxin Response Factor9 were significantly increased by <i>S. bovista</i> after the formation of mycorrhizal fungi in hazelnut root tips.

This whole process of mutual benefit requires substantial alterations in the structural and functional aspects of the host root cells. These modifications ultimately culminate in the formation of arbuscules, which are specialized intraradical and highly branched fungal structures. Arbuscule-containing cells undergo massive reprogramming to hosting arbuscule and members of the GRAS transcription factor family have been characterized as AM inducible genes which play a pivotal role in these process. Here, we show a functional analysis for the GRAS transcription factor SCL3/SlGRAS18 in tomato. SlGRAS18 interacts with SlDELLA, a central regulator of AM formation. Silencing of SlGRAS18 positively impacts arbuscule development and the improvement in symbiotic status, favouring flowering and therefore progress in the formation and development of fruits in SlGRAS18 silenced plants which parallel to a discernible pattern of mineral nutrient redistribution in leaves.

Several proteins key to this pathway have been discovered, but the AON pathway is not completely understood. We report a new hypernodulating mutant, defective in autoregulation, with disruption of a gene, DAR (Medtr2g450550/MtrunA17_Chr2g0304631), previously unknown to play a role in AON. The dar-1 mutant produces ten-fold more nodules than wild type, similar to AON mutants with disrupted SUNN gene function. As in sunn mutants, suppression of nodulation by CLE peptides MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 is abolished in dar. Furthermore, dar-1 also shows increased root length colonization by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, suggesting a role for DAR in autoregulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis (AOM). However, unlike SUNN which functions in the shoot to control nodulation, DAR functions in the root. DAR encodes a membrane protein that is a member of a small protein family in M. truncatula. Our results suggest that DAR could be involved in the subcellular transport of signals involved in symbiosis regulation, but it is not upregulated during symbiosis.

It is unclear whether these changes occur at the shift to the ECM habit or are more gradual throughout the evolution of ECM lineages. We generated a genomic dataset of 20 species in the ECM lineage Inocybaceae and compared them with six saprotrophic species. Inocybaceae genomes have fewer CAZymes, peptidases, lipases, secondary metabolite clusters and SSPs and higher TE content than their saprotrophic relatives. There was an increase in the rate of gene family evolution along the branch with the transition to the ECM lifestyle. This branch had very high rate of evolution in CAZymes and had the largest number of contractions.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",AMF inhibit the production of phenolic acid autotoxins at the seed-filling stage in soybeans with continuous monocropping.,"Soybean is the main oil crop in Northeast China. Continuous monocropping is more commonly used for soybean production due to rising market demand and arable land constraints. However, autotoxic substances, such as phenolic acids, produced by continuously cropped soybean can reduce yield and quality. The mycorrhiza formed of Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant roots regulate the metabolic activities of the host plant and increase its disease resistance. The main purpose of this study was to inhibit the production of phenolic acids and determine the adverse effects on the growth of continuous monocropping soybean by inoculating Funneliformis mosseae (F. mosseae). Transcriptomics results showed that the production of phenolic acids in continuous monocropping soybean roots was mainly regulated by the expression of the CHS6, PCL1, SAMT, SRG1, and ACO1 genes, and the expression of these genes was significantly downregulated after inoculation with F. mosseae. Metabolomics results showed that continuous monocropping soybean roots inoculated with F. mosseae inhibited phenolic acid production through the phenylpropane biosynthetic, -linoleic acid, linoleic acid, and other metabolic pathways. Phenolic acids in the phenylpropane metabolic pathway, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, phthalic acid, and vanillic acid, decreased significantly after inoculation with F. mosseae. The combined analysis of the two showed that genes such as YLS9 and ARF3 were positively correlated with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and so on, while genes such as CHS6 and SRG1 were negatively correlated with butyric acid and so on. F. mosseae regulated the expression of functional genes and related phenolic acid metabolic pathways produced by continuous monocropping soybean roots, inhibiting the production of phenolic acid autotoxic substances in continuous cropped soybean, and slowing down the disturbance of continuous monocropping. This study provides a new solution for continuous monocropping of plants to overcome the autotoxicity barrier and provides a new basis for the development and utilization of AMF as a biological agent.",39085801

In this review, we introduce the response and regulatory role of SL in salt, drought, light, heat, cold and cadmium stresses in plants. This review also discusses how SL alleviate the damage of abiotic stress in plants, furthermore, introducing the mechanisms of SL enhancing plant stress resistance at the genetic level. Under abiotic stress, the exogenous SL analog GR24 can induce the biosynthesis of SL in plants, and endogenous SL can alleviate the damage caused by abiotic stress. SL enhanced the stress resistance of plants by protecting photosynthesis, enhancing the antioxidant capacity of plants and promoting the symbiosis between plants and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). SL interact with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), auxin, cytokinin (CK), jasmonic acid (JA), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and other signal molecules to jointly regulate plant stress resistance.

Maize plants were cultivated in a split-root system, with half of the root system inoculated with the AM fungus and the other half uninoculated. Plant growth and hydraulic parameters were measured and aquaporin gene expression was determined in each root fraction and in microdissected cells. Under well-watered conditions, the non-colonized root fractions of AM plants grew more than the colonized root fraction. Total osmotic and hydrostatic root hydraulic conductivities (Lo and Lpr) were higher in AM plants than in non-mycorrhizal plants. The expression of most maize aquaporin genes analysed was different in the mycorrhizal root fraction than in the non-mycorrhizal root fraction of AM plants. At the cellular level, differential aquaporin expression in AM-colonized cells and in uncolonized cells was also observed.

These underground organs exhibit the plasticity to modify their root system architecture in response to environmental cues, allowing adaptation to change in water and nutrient availability. In addition, roots enter in mutualistic interactions with soil microorganisms, for example, the root nodule symbiosis (RNS) established between a limited group of plants and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria and the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis involving most land plants and fungi of the Glomeromycetes phylum. In the past 20 years, genetic approaches allowed the identification and functional characterization of genes required for the specific programs of root development, root nodule, and arbuscular mycorrhiza symbioses. These genetic studies provided evidence that the program of the RNS recruited components of the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis and the root developmental programs. The execution of these programs is strongly influenced by epigenetic changes-DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications-that alter chromatin conformation modifying the expression of key genes. In this review, we summarize recent advances that highlight how DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications, as well as chromatin remodeling factors and long noncoding RNAs, shape the root system architecture and allow the successful establishment of both root nodule and arbuscular mycorrhiza symbioses.

However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which Rhizophagus irregularis, an AM fungus, regulates flavonoids and lignin in B. papyrifera under Cd stress remain unclear. Here, a pot experiment of B. papyrifera inoculated and non-inoculated with R. irregularis under Cd stress was carried out. We determined flavonoids and lignin concentrations in B. papyrifera roots by LC-MS and GC-MS, respectively, and measured the transcriptional levels of flavonoids- or lignin-related genes in B. papyrifera roots, aiming to ascertain the key components of flavonoids or lignin, and key genes regulated by R. irregularis in response to Cd stress. Without R. irregularis, the concentrations of eriodictyol, quercetin and myricetin were significantly increased under Cd stress. The concentrations of eriodictyol and genistein were significantly increased by R. irregularis, while the concentration of rutin was significantly decreased.

Yet, how modern selection for dwarfing has affected symbiosis remains poorly documented. In this study, we evaluated the response of both the plant and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus to plant genetic variation at a major Quantitative Trait Locus called QTL 4B2, known to harbor a Rht dwarfing gene, when forming the symbiosis. We used twelve inbred genotypes derived from a diversity base broadened durum wheat Evolutionary Pre-breeding Population and genotyped with a high-throughput Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array. In a microcosm setup segregating roots and the extra-radical mycelium, each wheat genotype was grown with or without the presence of Rhizophagus irregularis. To characterize arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, we assessed hyphal density, root colonization, spore production, and plant biomass. Additionally, we split the variation of these variables due either to genotypes or to the Rht dwarfing genes alone. The fungus exhibited greater development in the roots of Dwarf plants compared to non-Dwarf plants, showing increases of 27%, 37% and 51% in root colonization, arbuscules, and vesicles, respectively. In addition, the biomass of the extra-radical fungal structures increased by around 31% in Dwarf plants. The biomass of plant roots decreased by about 43% in mycorrhizal Dwarf plants. Interestingly, extraradical hyphal production was found to be partly genetically determined with no significant effect of Rht, as for plant biomasses. In contrast, variations in root colonization, arbuscules and extraradical spore production were explained by Rht dwarfing genes. Finally, when mycorrhizal, Dwarf plants had significantly lower total P content, pointing towards a less beneficial symbiosis for the plant and increased profit for the fungus. These results highlight the effect of Rht dwarfing genes on both root and fungal development. This calls for further research into the molecular mechanisms governing these effects, as well as changes in plant physiology, and their implications for fostering arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in sustainable agrosystems.",38816524

By obtaining OsLysMepro:GUS transgenic plants and generating oslysme1, oslysme2 and oslysme1oslysme2 mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 technique, OsLysMe genes were revealed to be specifically induced in the arbusculated cells and mutations in either gene caused significantly reduced root colonization rate by AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Overexpression of OsLysMe1 or OsLysMe2 dramatically increased the colonization rates in rice and Medicago truncatula. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay supported that OsLysMe genes are regulated by OsWRI5a. Either OsLysMe1 or OsLysMe2 can efficiently rescue the impaired AM phenotype of the mtlysme2 mutant, supporting a conserved function of LysMe across monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. The co-localization of OsLysMe proteins with the apoplast marker SP-OsRAmy3A implies their probable localization to the periarbuscular space (PAS) during symbiosis. Relative to the fungal biomass marker RiTEF, some defense-related genes showed disproportionately high expression levels in the oslysme mutants.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",The phosphate starvation response regulator PHR2 antagonizes arbuscule maintenance in Medicago.,"Phosphate starvation response (PHR) transcription factors play essential roles in regulating phosphate uptake in plants through binding to the P1BS cis-element in the promoter of phosphate starvation response genes. Recently, PHRs were also shown to positively regulate arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in rice and lotus by controlling the expression of many symbiotic genes. However, their role in arbuscule development has remained unclear. In Medicago, we previously showed that arbuscule degradation is controlled by two SPX proteins that are highly expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. Since SPX proteins bind to PHRs and repress their activity in a phosphate-dependent manner, we investigated whether arbuscule maintenance is also regulated by PHR. Here, we show that PHR2 is a major regulator of the phosphate starvation response in Medicago. Knockout of phr2 showed reduced phosphate starvation response, symbiotic gene expression, and fungal colonization levels. However, the arbuscules that formed showed less degradation, suggesting a negative role for PHR2 in arbuscule maintenance. This was supported by the observation that overexpression of PHR2 led to enhanced degradation of arbuscules. Although many arbuscule-induced genes contain P1BS elements in their promoters, we found that the P1BS cis-elements in the promoter of the symbiotic phosphate transporter PT4 are not required for arbuscule-containing cell expression. Since both PHR2 and SPX1/3 negatively affect arbuscule maintenance, our results indicate that they control arbuscule maintenance partly via different mechanisms. While PHR2 potentiates symbiotic gene expression and colonization, its activity in arbuscule-containing cells needs to be tightly controlled to maintain a successful symbiosis in Medicago.",38803107

In addition, we have shown that 1,549 genes were differentially expressed, with 832 and 717 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively. The analysis also revealed that some rootstock genes involved in plant nutrition through the mycorrhizal pathway, are regulated similarly as in other mycorrhizal woody species: Vitis vinifera and Populus trichocarpa. In addition, an enrichment analysis performed on GO and KEGG pathways revealed some regulation specific to J. regia (i.e., the juglone pathway). This analysis reinforces the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis on root gene regulation and on the need to finely study the effects of diverse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on root gene regulation, but also of the scion on the functioning of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus in heterografted plants such as walnut tree.",38801470

However, unexpectedly, SlRAM1-overexpressing (UBIL:SlRAM1) plants also showed decreased mycorrhizal colonization. Analysis of non-mycorrhizal UBIL:SlRAM1 roots revealed an overall regulation of AM-related genes and a reduction of strigolactone biosynthesis. Moreover, external application of the strigolactone analogue GR244DO almost completely reversed the negative effects of SlRAM1 overexpression on the frequency of mycorrhization. However, it only partially recovered the pattern of arbuscule distribution observed in control plants. Our results strongly suggest that SlRAM1 has a dual regulatory role during mycorrhization and, in addition to its recognized action as a positive regulator of arbuscule development, it is also involved in different mechanisms for the negative regulation of mycorrhization, including the repression of strigolactone biosynthesis.",38726891

This suggests that the LysM mutations affect the ability of SlLYK10 to trigger signaling through a potential co-receptor rather than its ability to bind LCOs. Interestingly, tomato lines that contain a calcium (Ca2+) concentration reporter [genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECO)], showed Ca2+ spiking in response to LCO applications, but this occurred only in inner cell layers of the roots, while short-chain chitooligosaccharides also induced Ca2+ spiking in the epidermis. Moreover, LCO-induced Ca2+ spiking was decreased in Sllyk10-1*GECO plants, suggesting that the decrease in AMF colonization in Sllyk10-1 is due to abnormal LCO signaling.",38581668
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Fungal and bacterial communities and their associations in snow-free and snow covered (sub-)alpine Pinus cembra forest soils.,"In Europe, Pinus cembra forests cover subalpine and alpine areas and they are of high conservational and ecological relevance. These forests experience strong seasonality with alternating snow-free and snow covered periods. Although P. cembra is known for mycorrhization and mycorrhizae usually involve fungi, plants and bacteria, the community compositions of fungi and bacteria and their associations in (sub-)alpine P. cembra forests remain vastly understudied. Here, we studied the fungal and bacterial community compositions in three independent (sub-)alpine P. cembra forests and inferred their microbial associations using marker gene sequencing and network analysis. We asked about the effect of snow cover on microbial compositions and associations. In addition, we propose inferring microbial associations across a range of filtering criteria, based on which we infer well justified, concrete microbial associations with high potential for ecological relevance that are typical for P. cembra forests and depending on snow cover. The overall fungal and bacterial community structure was comparable with regards to both forest locations and snow cover. However, occurrence, abundance, and diversity patterns of several microbial taxa typical for P. cembra forests differed among snow-free and snow covered soils, e.g. Russula, Tetracladium and Phenoliphera. Moreover, network properties and microbial associations were influenced by snow cover. Here, we present concrete microbial associations on genus and species level that were repeatedly found across microbial networks, thereby confirming their ecological relevance. Most importantly, ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as Basidioascus, Pseudotomentella and Rhizopogon, as well as saprobic Mortierella changed their bacterial association partners depending on snow cover. This is the first study researching fungal-bacterial associations across several (sub-)alpine P. cembra forests. The poorly investigated influence of snow cover on soil fungi and bacteria, especially those mycorrhizing P. cembra roots, but also saprobic soil organisms, underlines the relevance of forest seasonality. Our findings highlight that the seasonal impact of snow cover has significant consequences for the ecology of the ecosystem, particularly in relation to mycorrhization and nutrient cycling. It is imperative to consider such effects for a comprehensive understanding of the functioning resilience and responsiveness of an ecosystem.",38566162
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Mycorrhiza-induced resistance in citrus against Tetranychus urticae is plant species dependent and inversely correlated to basal immunity.,"Mycorrhizal plants show enhanced resistance to biotic stresses, but few studies have addressed mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR) against biotic challenges in woody plants, particularly citrus. Here we present a comparative study of two citrus species, Citrus aurantium, which is resistant to Tetranychus urticae, and Citrus reshni, which is highly susceptible to T. urticae. Although both mycorrhizal species are protected in locally infested leaves, they show very distinct responses to MIR. Previous studies have indicated that C. aurantium is insensitive to MIR in systemic tissues and MIR-triggered antixenosis. Conversely, C. reshni is highly responsive to MIR which triggers local, systemic and indirect defense, and antixenosis against the pest. Transcriptional, hormonal and inhibition assays in C. reshni indicated the regulation of jasmonic acid (JA)- and abscisic acid-dependent responses in MIR. The phytohormone jasmonic acid isoleucine (JA-Ile) and the JA biosynthesis gene LOX2 are primed at early timepoints. Evidence indicates a metabolic flux from phenylpropanoids to specific flavones that are primed at 24h post infestation (hpi). MIR also triggers the priming of naringenin in mycorrhizal C. reshni, which shows a strong correlation with several flavones and JA-Ile that over-accumulate in mycorrhizal plants. Treatment with an inhibitor of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis C4H enzyme impaired resistance and reduced the symbiosis, demonstrating that phenylpropanoids and derivatives mediate MIR in C. reshni. MIR's effectiveness is inversely correlated to basal immunity in different citrus species, and provides multifaceted protection against T. urticae in susceptible C. reshni, activating rapid local and systemic defenses that are mainly regulated by the accumulation of specific flavones and priming of JA-dependent responses.  2024 The Authors.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) has emerged as a potential solution by increasing the surface area of a plant's root system and enhancing the absorption of phosphorus, nitrogen nutrients, and water. Consequently, there is a longstanding hypothesis that rice varieties exhibiting more efficient AMS could yield higher outputs at reduced input costs, paving the way for the development of Green Super Rice (GSR). Our prior research study identified a variant, <i>OsCERK1</i><sup><i>DY</i></sup>, derived from Dongxiang wild-type rice, which notably enhanced AMS efficiency in the rice cultivar ""ZZ35."" This variant represents a promising gene for enhancing yield and nutrient use efficiency in rice breeding. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of biomass, crop growth characteristics, yield attributes, and nutrient absorption at varying soil nitrogen levels in the rice cultivar ""ZZ35"" and its chromosome single-segment substitution line, ""GJDN1."" In the field, GJDN1 exhibited a higher AM colonization level in its roots compared with ZZ35. Notably, GJDN1 displayed significantly higher effective panicle numbers and seed-setting rates than ZZ35. Moreover, the yield of GJDN1 with 75% nitrogen was 14.27% greater than the maximum yield achieved using ZZ35. At equivalent nitrogen levels, GJDN1 consistently outperformed ZZ35 in chlorophyll (Chl) content, dry matter accumulation, major nutrient element accumulation, N agronomic efficiency (NAE), N recovery efficiency (NRE), and N partial factor productivity (NPFP). The performance of <i>OsCERK1</i><sup><i>DY</i></sup> overexpression lines corroborated these findings. These results support a model wherein the heightened level of AMS mediated by <i>OsCERK1</i><sup><i>DY</i></sup> contributes to increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium accumulation. This enhancement in nutrient utilization promotes higher fertilizer efficiency, dry matter accumulation, and ultimately, rice yield. Consequently, the <i>OsCERK1</i><sup><i>DY</i></sup> gene emerges as a robust candidate for improving yield, reducing fertilizer usage, and facilitating a transition towards greener, lower-carbon agriculture.

They play a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. Phaseolus vulgaris, a significant legume crop, serves as a valuable model for studying root symbiosis. In this study, we have conducted an exploration of the AAT gene family in P. vulgaris. In this research, we identified 84 AAT genes within the P. vulgaris genome sequence and categorized them into 12 subfamilies based on their similarity and phylogenetic relationships with AATs found in Arabidopsis and rice. Interestingly, these AAT genes were not evenly distributed across the chromosomes of P. vulgaris . Instead, there was an unusual concentration of these genes located toward the outer edges of chromosomal arms. Upon conducting motif analysis and gene structural analysis, we observed a consistent presence of similar motifs and an intron-exon distribution pattern among the subfamilies. When we analyzed the expression profiles of PvAAT genes, we noted tissue-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, our investigation into AAT gene expression under rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiotic conditions revealed that certain genes exhibited high levels of expression. Specifically, ATLa5 and LHT2 was notably upregulated under both symbiotic conditions. These findings point towards a potential role of AATs in the context of rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis in P. vulgaris, in addition to their well-established regulatory functions.",38430379

To gain genomic insights into the medicinal properties of T. cordifolia, the genome sequencing was carried out using 10Genomics linked read and Nanopore long-read technologies. The draft genome assembly of T. cordifolia was comprised of 1.01 Gbp, which is the genome sequenced from the plant family Menispermaceae. We also performed the genome size estimation for T. cordifolia, which was found to be 1.13 Gbp. The deep sequencing of transcriptome from the leaf tissue was also performed. The genome and transcriptome assemblies were used to construct the gene set, resulting in 17,245 coding gene sequences. Further, the phylogenetic position of T. cordifolia was also positioned as basal eudicot by constructing a genome-wide phylogenetic tree using multiple species. Further, a comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of gene families contraction/expansion and multiple signatures of adaptive evolution was performed. The genes involved in benzyl iso-quinoline alkaloid, terpenoid, lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were found with signatures of adaptive evolution. These evolutionary adaptations in genes provide genomic insights into the presence of diverse medicinal properties of this plant. The genes involved in the common symbiosis signalling pathway associated with endosymbiosis (Arbuscular Mycorrhiza) were found to be adaptively evolved.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Soil microbial community response to ectomycorrhizal dominance in diverse neotropical montane forests.,"Ectomycorrhizal (EM) associations can promote the dominance of tree species in otherwise diverse tropical forests. These EM associations between trees and their fungal mutualists have important consequences for soil organic matter cycling, yet the influence of these EM-associated effects on surrounding microbial communities is not well known, particularly in neotropical forests. We examined fungal and prokaryotic community composition in surface soil samples from mixed arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) stands as well as stands dominated by EM-associated Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae) in four watersheds differing in soil fertility in the Fortuna Forest Reserve, Panama. We hypothesized that EM-dominated stands would support distinct microbial community assemblages relative to the mixed AM-EM stands due to differences in carbon and nitrogen cycling associated with the dominance of EM trees. We expected that this microbiome selection in EM-dominated stands would lead to lower overall microbial community diversity and turnover, with tighter correspondence between general fungal and prokaryotic communities. We measured fungal and prokaryotic community composition via high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the ITS2 (fungi) and 16S rRNA (prokaryotic) gene regions. We analyzed differences in alpha and beta diversity between forest stands associated with different mycorrhizal types, as well as the relative abundance of fungal functional groups and various microbial taxa. We found that fungal and prokaryotic community composition differed based on stand mycorrhizal type. There was lower prokaryotic diversity and lower relative abundance of fungal saprotrophs and pathogens in EM-dominated than AM-EM mixed stands. However, contrary to our prediction, there was lower homogeneity for fungal communities in EM-dominated stands compared to mixed AM-EM stands. Overall, we demonstrate that EM-dominated tropical forest stands have distinct soil microbiomes relative to surrounding diverse forests, suggesting that EM fungi may filter microbial functional groups in ways that could potentially influence plant performance or ecosystem function.",38183463

The toxicity of aluminum (Al) limits the growth and performance of cultivated plants in acidic soil. However, there is limited information available on the relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and the AsA-GSH cycle in host plants under Al stress. This study aimed to examine the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), specifically <i>Funneliformis</i> <i>mosseae</i>, on the growth, antioxidant enzymes, components of the AsA-GSH cycle, and stress response gene expressions in white clover (<i>Trifolium</i> <i>repens</i> L.) under Al stress. Our findings demonstrate that AMF inoculation significantly reduced Al accumulation and increased phosphorus (P) content in the roots of white clover, thereby promoting plant biomass accumulation and mycorrhizal colonization under Al stress. AMF effectively scavenged Al-induced ROS (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as the components of the AsA-GSH cycle (e.g., enzymes and antioxidants) in the leaves and roots of white clover plants. Additionally, the mitigating effect of AMF was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in P transport (<i>PHO1-2</i> and <i>PHT1-7</i>), the AsA-GSH pathway (<i>GST-2</i> and <i>APX-2</i>), and Al stress (<i>ALMT1</i>) in white clover roots compared to control plants. Principal component analysis revealed that 65.9% of the total variance was explained by the first principal component. Dry mass showed a positive correlation with POD and P content, while exhibiting a highly negative correlation with ROS, antioxidant physiology index, Al content, and the expression of related genes in white clover. Overall, this study suggests that AMF enhances the tolerance of white clover to Al stress by improving P uptake and strengthening the AsA-GSH cycle.",38162922

However, current understanding of the phoD-harboring bacterial community associated with AM fungal hyphae responses to organic P levels remains incomplete. Here, two-compartment microcosms were used to explore the response of the phoD-harboring bacterial community in the hyphosphere to organic P levels by high-throughput sequencing. Extraradical hyphae of Funneliformis mosseae enriched the phoD-harboring bacterial community and organic P levels significantly altered the composition of the phoD-harboring bacterial community in the Funneliformis mosseae hyphosphere. The relative abundance of dominant families Pseudomonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae was significantly different among organic P treatments and were positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity and available P concentration in the hyphosphere. Furthermore, phytin addition significantly decreased the abundance of the phoD gene, and the latter was significantly and negatively correlated with available P concentration. These findings not only improve the understanding of how organic P influences the phoD-harboring bacterial community but also provide a new insight into AM fungus-PSB interactions at the community level to drive organic P turnover in soil.",38129688

However, the roles of cell wall proteins and cell wall synthesis in AM symbiosis remain unclear. We reported that a novel wall-associated kinase 13 (GhWAK13) positively regulates AM symbiosis and negatively regulates Verticillium wilt resistance in cotton. GhWAK13 transcription was induced by AM symbiosis and Verticillium dahliae (VD) infection. GhWAK13 is located in the plasma membrane and expressed in the arbuscule-containing cortical cells of mycorrhizal cotton roots. GhWAK13 silencing inhibited AM colonization and repressed gene expression of the mycorrhizal pathway. Moreover, GhWAK13 silencing improved Verticillium wilt resistance and triggered the expression of immunity genes. Therefore, GhWAK13 is considered an immune suppressor required for AM symbiosis and disease resistance. GhWAK7A, a positive regulator of Verticillium wilt resistance, was upregulated in GhWAK13-silenced cotton plants. Silencing GhWAK7A improved AM symbiosis. Oligogalacturonides application also suppressed AM symbiosis. Finally, GhWAK13 negatively affected the cellulose content by regulating the transcription of cellulose synthase genes. The results of this study suggest that immunity suppresses AM symbiosis in cotton. GhWAK13 affects AM symbiosis by suppressing immune responses.",38095050
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Mycorrhizal fungus Serendipita indica-associated acid phosphatase rescues the phosphate nutrition with reduced arsenic uptake in the host plant under arsenic stress.,"Symbiotic interactions play a vital role in maintaining the phosphate (Pi) nutrient status of host plants and providing resilience during biotic and abiotic stresses. Serendipita indica, a mycorrhiza-like fungus, supports plant growth by transporting Pi to the plant. Despite the competitive behaviour of arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>) with Pi, the association with S. indica promotes plant growth under arsenic (As) stress by reducing As bioavailability through adsorption, accumulation, and precipitation within the fungus. However, the capacity of S. indica to enhance Pi accumulation and utilization under As stress remains unexplored. Axenic studies revealed that As supply significantly reduces intracellular ACPase activity in S. indica, while extracellular ACPase remains unaffected. Further investigations using Native PAGE and gene expression studies confirmed that intracellular ACPase (isoform2) is sensitive to As, whereas extracellular ACPase (isoform1) is As-insensitive. Biochemical analysis showed that ACPase (isoform1) has a Km of 0.5977M and Vmax of 0.1945 Unit/min. In hydroponically cultured tomato seedlings, simultaneous inoculation of S. indica with As on the 14thday after seed germination led to hyper-colonization, increased root/shoot length, biomass, and induction of ACPase expression and secretion under As stress. Arsenic-treated S. indica colonized groups (13.33M As+Si and 26.67M As+Si) exhibited 8.28-19.14 and 1.71-3.45-fold activation of ACPase in both rhizospheric media and root samples, respectively, thereby enhancing Pi availability in the surrounding medium under As stress. Moreover, S. indica (13.33M As+Si and 26.67M As+Si) significantly improved Pi accumulation in roots by 7.26 and 9.46 times and in shoots by 4.36 and 8.85 times compared to the control. Additionally, S. indica induced the expression of SiPT under As stress, further improving Pi mobilization. Notably, fungal colonization also restricted As mobilization from the hydroponic medium to the shoot, with a higher amount of As (191.01ppm As in the 26.67M As+Si group) accumulating in the plant's roots. The study demonstrates the performance of S. indica under As stress in enhancing Pi mobilization while limiting As uptake in the host plant. These findings provide the first evidence of the As-Pi interaction in the AM-like fungus S. indica, indicating reduced As uptake and regulation of PHO genes (ACPase and SiPT genes) to increase Pi acquisition. These data also lay the foundation for the rational use of S. indica in agricultural practices.",38061081

Most Rboh gene family-related studies mainly focused on dicotyledonous plants; however, little is known about the roles of Rboh genes in gramineae. A total of 106 Rboh genes were identified in seven gramineae species, including Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Setaria italica, Hordeum vulgare, and Triticumaestivum. The Rboh protein sequences showed high similarities, suggesting that they may have conserved functions across different species. Duplication mode analysis detected whole-genome/segmental duplication (WGD)/(SD) and dispersed in the seven species. Interestingly, two local duplication (LD, including tandem and proximal duplication) modes were found in Z. mays, S. italica and H. vulgare, while four LD were detected in T. aestivum, indicating that these genes may have similar functions. Collinearity analysis indicated that Rboh genes are at a stable evolution state in all the seven species. Besides, Rboh genes from Z. mays were closely related to those from S. bicolor, consistent with the current understanding of plant evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes in the subgroups I and II may participate in plant-AM fungus symbiosis. Cis-element analysis showed that different numbers of elements are related to fungal induction in the promoter region. Expression profiles of Rboh genes in Z. mays suggested that Rboh genes had distinct spatial expression patterns. By inoculation with AM fungi, our transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of Rboh genes varies upon AM fungal inoculation. In particularly, ZmRbohF was significantly upregulated after inoculation with AM fungi. pZmRbohF::GUS expression analyses indicated that ZmRbohF was induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in maize. By comparing WT and ZmRbohF mutant, we found ZmRbohF had limited impact on the establishment of maize-AM fungi symbiosis, but play critical roles in regulating the proper development of arbuscules. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution relationship of Rboh genes in seven gramineae species. Results showed that several Rboh genes regulate maize-AM fungal symbiosis process.

The modulation of intracellular calcium concentration-a common second messenger in a wide variety of plant signal transduction processes-plays a central role in both signalling pathways with distinct signature features. Nevertheless, mounting evidence suggests that plant immunity and symbiosis signalling partially overlap at multiple levels. Here, we elaborate on recent findings on this topic, highlighting the nonbinary nature of chitin-based fungal signals, their perception and their interpretation through Ca<sup>2+</sup> -mediated intracellular signals. Based on this, we propose that plant perception of symbiotic and pathogenic fungi is less clear-cut than previously described and involves a more complex scenario in which partially overlapping and blurred signalling mechanisms act upstream of the unambiguous regulation of gene expression driving accommodation or defence responses.",38013492

Here, we report characterization of RiCRD1, a Rhizophagus irregularis gene putatively encoding a Cu transporting ATPase. Based on its sequence analysis, RiCRD1 was identified as a plasma membrane Cu<sup>+</sup>efflux protein of the P<sub>1B1</sub>-ATPase subfamily. As revealed by heterologous complementation assays in yeast, RiCRD1 encodes a functional protein capable of conferring increased tolerance against Cu. In the extraradical mycelium, RiCRD1 expression was highly up-regulated in response to high concentrations of Cu in the medium. Comparison of the expression patterns of different players of metal tolerance in R. irregularis under high Cu levels suggests that this fungus could mainly use a metal efflux based-strategy to cope with Cu toxicity. RiCRD1 was also expressed in the intraradical fungal structures and, more specifically, in the arbuscules, which suggests a role for RiCRD1 in Cu release from the fungus to the symbiotic interface. Overall, our results show that RiCRD1 encodes a protein which could have a pivotal dual role in Cu homeostasis in R. irregularis, playing a role in Cu detoxification in the extraradical mycelium and in Cu transfer to the apoplast of the symbiotic interface in the arbuscules.",37992950

By increasing nutrient availability, uptake and soil anchoring of plants, AMF can improve plant's growth and tolerance to abiotic stresses. AMF can also reduce symptoms and pathogen load on infected plants, both locally and systemically, through a phenomenon called mycorrhiza induced resistance (MIR). There is scarce information on rice mycorrhization, despite the high potential of this symbiosis in a context of sustainable water management in rice production systems. We studied the symbiotic compatibility (global mycorrhization & arbuscules intensity) and MIR phenotypes between six rice cultivars from two subspecies (<i>indica</i>: IR64 & Phka Rumduol; <i>japonica</i>: Nipponbare, Kitaake, Azucena & Zhonghua 11) and three AMF genotypes (<i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> FR140 (FM), <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> DAOM197198 (RIR) & <i>R. intraradices</i> FR121 (RIN)). The impact of mycorrhization on rice growth and defence response to <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (Xoo) infection was recorded via both phenotypic indexes and rice marker gene expression studies. All three AMF genotypes colonise the roots of all rice varieties, with clear differences in efficiency depending on the combination under study (from 27% to 84% for Phka Rumduol-RIN and Nipponbare-RIR combinations, respectively). Mycorrhization significantly (=0.05) induced negative to beneficial effects on rice growth (impact on dry weight ranging from -21% to 227% on Azucena-FM and Kitaake-RIN combinations, respectively), and neutral to beneficial effects on the extent of Xoo symptoms on leaves (except for Azucena-RIN combination which showed a 68% increase of chlorosis). <i>R. irregularis</i> DAOM197198 was the most compatible AMF partner of rice, with high root colonisation intensity (84% of Nipponbare's roots hyphal colonisation), beneficial effects on rice growth (dry weight +28% (IR64) to +178% (Kitaake)) and decrease of Xoo-induced symptoms (-6% (Nipponbare) to -27% (IR64)). Transcriptomic analyses by RT-qPCR on leaves of two rice cultivars contrasting in their association with AMF show two different patterns of response on several physiological marker genes.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Identification of microRNAs involved in ectomycorrhizal formation in Populus tomentosa.,"The majority of woody plants are able to form ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses with fungi. During symbiotic development, plants undergo a complex re-programming process involving a series of physiological and morphological changes.

To elucidate the mechanisms of miRNAs and miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage during symbiotic development, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs and degradome tags from roots of Populus tomentosa inoculated with Cenococcum geophilum. This process led to the annotation of 51 differentially expressed miRNAs between non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal roots of P. tomentosa, including 13 novel miRNAs. Increased or decreased accumulation of several novel and conserved miRNAs in ECM roots, including miR162, miR164, miR319, miR396, miR397, miR398, novel-miR44 and novel-miR47, suggests essential roles for these miRNAs in ECM formation. The degradome analysis identified root transcripts as miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage targets, which was confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR. Several of the identified miRNAs and corresponding targets are involved in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses.

In this study, we evaluated the drought responses of the host and symbiont, using the fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> with carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i>) as a plant model. Carrots inoculated with spores of <i>R. irregularis</i> DAOM 197198 were grown in a greenhouse. During taproot development, carrots were exposed to a 10-day water restriction. Compared with well-watered conditions, drought caused diminished photosynthetic activity and reduced plant growth in carrot with and without AM fungi. Droughted carrots had lower root colonization. For <i>R. irregularis</i>, 93% of 826 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated during drought, including phosphate transporters, several predicted transport proteins of potassium, and the aquaporin <i>RiAQPF2</i>. In contrast, 78% of 2,486 DEGs in AM carrot were downregulated during drought, including the symbiosis-specific genes <i>FatM</i>, <i>RAM2</i>, and <i>STR</i>, which are implicated in lipid transfer from the host to the fungus and were upregulated exclusively in AM carrot during well-watered conditions. Overall, this study provides insight into the drought response of an AM fungus in relation to its host; the expression of genes related to symbiosis and nutrient exchange were downregulated in carrot but upregulated in the fungus. This study reveals that carrot and <i>R. irregularis</i> exhibit contrast in their regulation of gene expression during drought, with carrot reducing its apparent investment in symbiosis and the fungus increasing its apparent symbiotic efforts.

Different methodologies have been developed to assess the AMF-plant symbiosis. The most applied method, which involves staining of roots and microscopic observation of the AMF structures, is tedious and time-consuming and the results are highly dependent on the observer. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to quantify AMF root colonization represents a reliable, high-throughput technique that allows the assessment of numerous samples. Quantification with qPCR can be performed through two methods: relative quantification and absolute quantification. In relative quantification, the target gene is normalized with a reference gene. On the other hand, absolute quantification involves the use of a standard curve, for which template DNA is serially diluted. In a previous paper, we validated the primer pair AMG1F and AM1 for a relative quantification approach to assess AMF root colonization in Petunia. Here, we tested the same primers with an absolute quantification approach and compared the results with the traditional microscopy method. We evaluated the qPCR method with three different crops, namely, wheat (cv. Colmetta and Wiwa), tomato, and leek. We observed a strong correlation between microscopy and qPCR for Colmetta (r=0.90, p<0.001), Wiwa (r=0.94, p<0.001), and tomato (r=0.93, p<0.001), but no correlation for leek (r=0.27, p=0.268).

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Interaction of calcium responsive proteins and transcriptional factors with the PHO regulon in yeasts and fungi.,"Phosphate and calcium ions are nutrients that play key roles in growth, differentiation and the production of bioactive secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi. Phosphate concentration regulates the biosynthesis of hundreds of fungal metabolites. The central mechanisms of phosphate transport and regulation, mediated by the master Pho4 transcriptional factor are known, but many aspects of the control of gene expression need further research. High ATP concentration in the cells leads to inositol pyrophosphate molecules formation, such as IP3 and IP7, that act as phosphorylation status reporters. Calcium ions are intracellular messengers in eukaryotic organisms and calcium homeostasis follows elaborated patterns in response to different nutritional and environmental factors, including cross-talking with phosphate concentrations. A large part of the intracellular calcium is stored in vacuoles and other organelles forming complexes with polyphosphate. The free cytosolic calcium concentration is maintained by transport from the external medium or by release from the store organelles through calcium permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Calcium ions, particularly the free cytosolic calcium levels, control the biosynthesis of fungal metabolites by two mechanisms, 1) direct interaction of calcium-bound calmodulin with antibiotic synthesizing enzymes, and 2) by the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling cascade. Control of very different secondary metabolites, including pathogenicity determinants, are mediated by calcium through the Crz1 factor. Several interactions between calcium homeostasis and phosphate have been demonstrated in the last decade: 1) The inositol pyrophosphate IP3 triggers the release of calcium ions from internal stores into the cytosol, 2) Expression of the high affinity phosphate transporter Pho89, a Na+/phosphate symporter, is controlled by Crz1. Also, mutants defective in the calcium permeable TRPCa7-like of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> shown impaired expression of Pho89. This information suggests that CrzA and Pho89 play key roles in the interaction of phosphate and calcium regulatory pathways, 3) Finally, acidocalcisomes organelles have been found in mycorrhiza and in some melanin producing fungi that show similar characteristics as protozoa calcisomes. In these organelles there is a close interaction between orthophosphate, pyrophosphate and polyphosphate and calcium ions that are absorbed in the polyanionic polyphosphate matrix.

Grapevine is one of the major crops in the world. Vitis vinifera scions generally are grafted onto a variety of rootstocks that confer different levels of resistance against different pests, tolerance to environmental stress, and influence the physiology of the scions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are involved in the root architecture and in the immune response to soil-borne pathogens. However, the fine-tuned regulation and the transcriptomic plasticity of rootstocks in response to mycorrhization are still unknown. We compared the responses of 10 different grapevine rootstocks to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) formed with Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198 using RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling. We have highlighted a few shared regulation mechanisms, but also specific rootstock responses to R. irregularis colonization. A set of 353 genes was regulated by AMS in all ten rootstocks. We also compared the expression level of this set of genes to more than 2000 transcriptome profiles from various grapevine varieties and tissues to identify a class of transcripts related to mycorrhizal associations in these 10 rootstocks. Then, we compared the response of the 351 genes upregulated by mycorrhiza in grapevine to their Medicago truncatula homologs in response to mycorrhizal colonization based on available transcriptomic studies.

Generally, plants gain access to valuable resources including nutrients and water through the AM symbiosis and are more resistant to pests. Nevertheless, aphids' performance improves on mycorrhizal plants, and it remains unclear whether a more nutritious food source and/or attenuated defenses are the contributing factors. This study examined the shoot and root transcriptome of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) plants highly colonized by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis (Blaszk., Wubet, Renker, and Buscot) C. Walker and A. Schler (Glomerales: Glomeraceae) and exposed to 7 days of mixed age pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)) herbivory. The RNA-seq samples chosen for this study showed that aphids were heavier when fed mycorrhizal plants compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. We hypothesized that (i) insect-related plant defense pathways will be downregulated in shoots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids compared to nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids; (ii) pathways involved in nutrient acquisition, carbohydrate-related and amino acid transport will be upregulated in shoots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids compared to nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids; and (iii) roots of mycorrhizal plants with aphids will exhibit mycorrhiza-induced resistance. The transcriptome data revealed that the gene repertoire related to defenses, nutrient transport, and carbohydrates differs between nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants with aphids, which could explain the weight gain in aphids. We also identified novel candidate genes that are differentially expressed in nonmycorrhizal plants with aphids, thus setting the stage for future functional studies.",37467039

Among them is Voyriella parviflora, a species of the family Gentianaceae, which is found in tropical regions such as the Amazon basin. Here, we assessed the identity of AMF symbionts associated with this species. DNA was isolated from eight Gentianaceae specimens and from litter and surrounding roots of photosynthetic plants. The atp1 gene was amplified by Sanger sequencing to determine the taxonomic affiliation of the mycoheterotrophic plants. A 280bp region of the 18S rRNA gene of AMF was amplified with primers NS31/AML2 by high-throughput sequencing. The mycoheterotrophic specimens were assigned to V. parviflora with a bootstrap support of 72%. Glomus was the most abundant AMF genus, both in the mycoheterotrophic plants and in the litter and roots of photosynthetic plants. In addition, a few Glomus genotypes were abundantly enriched in the mycoheterotrophic plants, with only a few specimens colonized by Gigaspora, Acaulospora, and Scutellospora in a low proportion. These genotypes formed a cluster within a larger clade, suggesting that V. parviflora shows a preferential association with a narrow Glomus lineage which is not phylogenetically close to a previously identified V. parviflora's associated lineage. Furthermore, detecting fungi from other families suggests that V. parviflora is colonized by other genera, although with low frequency.

In addition to carbon, orchid mycorrhizal fungi provide the host plant with essential nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. In mycorrhizal protocorms, nutrients transfer occurs in plant cells colonized by the intracellular fungal coils, or pelotons. Whereas the transfer of these vital nutrients to the orchid protocorm in the OM symbiosis has been already investigated, there is currently no information on the transfer of sulfur (S). Here, we used ultra-high spatial resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) as well as targeted gene expression studies and laser microdissection to decipher S metabolism and transfer in the model system formed by the Mediterranean orchid Serapias vomeracea and the mycorrhizal fungus Tulasnella calospora. We revealed that the fungal partner is actively involved in S supply to the host plant, and expression of plant and fungal genes involved in S uptake and metabolism, both in the symbiotic and asymbiotic partners, suggest that S transfer most likely occurs as reduced organic forms. Thus, this study provides originalinformation about the regulation of S metabolism in OM protocorms, adding a piece of the puzzle on the nutritional framework in OM symbiosis.",37421313

In addition, it is thought that increasing the efficiency of plant expansin genes in plants plays a significant role, especially in the production of secondary bioethanol. When the studies on the expansin genes are examined, it is seen that the expansin genes are a significant gene family in the cell wall expansion mechanism.

By sequencing the large subunit region of the rRNA gene, we identified a total of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in 33 root samples. These OTUs belonged to the genera Rhizophagus, Dominikia, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora. The majority of these OTUs did not closely match any known AMF species.

So far, fungal colonization and the AMF diversity of calamine-inhabiting legumes have been poorly studied. Thus, we determined AMF spore density in the substratum and the mycorrhizal status of nodulated <i>A. vulneraria</i> plants occurring on calamine tailings (M) and on a reference non-metallicolous (NM) site. The results indicate the presence of the <i>Arum</i>-type of arbuscular mycorrhiza in the roots of both Anthyllis ecotypes. Despite the presence of AM fungi in M plant roots, the dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungi (hyphae and microsclerotia) were occasionally also detected. Metal ions were accumulated mainly in the nodules and intraradical fungal structures rather than thick plant cell walls. Mycorrhization parameters (frequency of mycorrhization and intensity of root cortex colonization) for M plants were markedly higher and differed in a statistically significant manner from the parameters for NM plants. Heavy metal excess had no negative effect on the number of AMF spores, the amounts of glomalin-related soil proteins and AMF species composition. Molecular identification of AMF using PCR-DGGE analysis based on the 18S rDNA ribosomal gene by nested-PCR with primers AM1/NS31 and NS31-GC/Glo1 revealed similar genera/species of AMF in the roots of both Anthyllis ecotypes: <i>Rhizophagus</i> sp., <i>R. fasciculatus</i>, and <i>R. iranicus</i>.

The identification of genes controlling AM symbiotic efficiency may have practical application in the creation of highly productive plant-microbe systems. The aim of our work was to evaluate the expression levels of SWEET sugar transporter genes, the only family in which sugar transporters specific to AM symbiosis can be detected. We have selected a unique ""host plant-AM fungus"" model system with high response to mycorrhization under medium phosphorus level. This includes a plant line which is highly responsive to inoculation by AM fungi, an ecologically obligate mycotrophic line MlS-1 from black medick (Medicago lupulina) and the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis strain RCAM00320, which has a high efficiency in a number of plant species. Using the selected model system, differences in the expression levels of 11 genes encoding SWEET transporters in the roots of the host plant were evaluated during the development of or in the absence of symbiosis of M. lupulina with R. irregularis at various stages of the host plant development in the presence of medium level of phosphorus available for plant nutrition in the substrate. At most stages of host plant development, mycorrhizal plants had higher expression levels of MlSWEET1b, MlSWEET3c, MlSWEET12 and MlSWEET13 compared to AM-less controls. Also, increased expression relative to control during mycorrhization was observed for MlSWEET11 at 2nd and 3rd leaf development stages, for MlSWEET15c at stemming (stooling) stage, for MlSWEET1a at 2nd leaf development, stemming and lateral branching stages.

Whether AtMYB75 can be used as a reporter gene in the hairy roots of tomato and if the anthocyanins accumulating in the roots will affect AMF colonization, however, are still unknown. In this study, the one-step cutting method was used for tomato hairy root transformation by A.rhizogenes. It is faster and has a higher transformation efficiency than the conventional method. AtMYB75 was used as a reporter gene in tomato hairy root transformation. The results showed that the overexpression of AtMYB75 caused anthocyanin accumulation in the transformed hairy roots.

Expansion and divergence of the gene family during evolution have led to various roles in symbiosis and defense. By studying proteins of the LYR-IA subclass of LysM-RLKs of the Poaceae, we show here that they are high-affinity LCO-binding proteins with a lower affinity for COs, consistent with a role in LCO perception to establish arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). In Papilionoid legumes, whole-genome duplication has resulted in two LYR-IA paralogs, MtLYR1 and MtNFP in Medicago truncatula, with MtNFP playing an essential role in root nodule symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. We show that MtLYR1 has retained the ancestral LCO-binding characteristic and is dispensable for AM. Domain swapping between the three LysMs of MtNFP and MtLYR1 and mutagenesis in MtLYR1 suggest that the MtLYR1 LCO-binding site is on the second LysM and that divergence in MtNFP led to better nodulation, but surprisingly with decreased LCO binding. These results suggest that divergence of the LCO-binding site has been important for the evolution of a role of MtNFP in nodulation with rhizobia.",37098213

We measured plant physiological responses, root hydraulic parameters, aquaporin gene expression and protein abundances and sap hormonal content. The results showed that dual AM + Bm inoculation was more effective against combined D + T stress than single inoculation. This was related to a synergistic enhancement of efficiency of the phytosystem II, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activity. Moreover, dually inoculated plants maintained higher root hydraulic conductivity, which was related to regulation of the aquaporins <i>ZmPIP1;3</i>, <i>ZmTIP1.1</i>, <i>ZmPIP2;2</i> and <i>GintAQPF1</i> and levels of plant sap hormones.

Herein, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses of symbiotic (Ri) and asymbiotic (CK) cassava roots and explored AM-induced biochemical and transcriptional changes. Three weeks (3w) after AMF inoculations, proliferating fungal hyphae were observable, and plant height and root length were significantly increased. In total, we identified 1,016 metabolites, of which 25 were differentially accumulated (DAMs) at 3w. The most highly induced metabolites were 5-aminolevulinic acid, L-glutamic acid, and lysoPC 18:2. Transcriptome analysis identified 693 and 6,481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparison between CK (3w) against Ri at 3w and 6w, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses of DAMs and DEGs unveiled transport, amino acids and sugar metabolisms, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interactions as the most differentially regulated pathways. Potential candidate genes, including nitrogen and phosphate transporters, transcription factors, phytohormone, sugar metabolism-related, and SYM (symbiosis) signaling pathway-related, were identified for future functional studies.

However, the underlying mechanisms how AMF and hyphae-associated microbes may cooperate to influence N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from ""hot spot"" residue patches remain unclear. Here we explored the key microbes in the hyphosphere involved in N<sub>2</sub>O production and consumption using amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Chemotaxis, growth and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of isolated N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing bacteria in response to hyphal exudates were tested using in vitro cultures and inoculation experiments. AMF hyphae reduced denitrification-derived N<sub>2</sub>O emission (max. 63%) in C- and N-rich residue patches. AMF consistently enhanced the abundance and expression of clade I nosZ gene, and inconsistently increased that of nirS and nirK genes. The reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the hyphosphere was linked to N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing Pseudomonas specifically enriched by AMF, concurring with the increase in the relative abundance of the key genes involved in bacterial citrate cycle. Phenotypic characterization of the isolated complete denitrifying P. fluorescens strain JL1 (possessingclade I nosZ) indicated that the decline of net N<sub>2</sub>O emission was a result of upregulated nosZ expression in P. fluorescens following hyphal exudation (e.g. carboxylates). These findings were further validated by re-inoculating sterilized residue patches with P. fluorescens and by an 11-year-long field experiment showing significant positive correlation between hyphal length density with the abundance of clade I nosZ gene. The cooperation between AMF and the N<sub>2</sub>O-reducing Pseudomonas residing on hyphae significantly reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the microsites. Carboxylates exuded by hyphae act as attractants in recruiting P. fluorescens and also as stimulants triggering nosZ gene expression. Our discovery indicates that reinforcing synergies between AMF and hyphosphere microbiome may provide unexplored opportunities to stimulate N<sub>2</sub>O consumption in nutrient-enriched microsites, and consequently reduce N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils.

Pistachio seedlings (N:36) were randomly assigned to AMF inoculation and non-inoculation groups in a pot experiment with 9 replications. Each group was further divided and randomly assigned to two salinity treatments (0 and 300mM NaCl). At the end of week 4, three pistachio plantlets were randomly selected from each group for <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> colonization inspection, physiological and biochemical assays, and biomass measurements. Salinity activated enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems in the pistachio plants werestudied.

Cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) play pivotal roles in transmembrane signaling, while few RLCKs are known to function in AM symbiosis. Here, we show that 27 out of 40 AM-induced kinases (AMKs) are transcriptionally upregulated by key AM transcription factors in Lotus japonicus. Nine AMKs are only conserved in AM-host lineages, among which the SPARK-RLK-encoding gene KINASE3 (KIN3) and the RLCK paralogues AMK8 and AMK24 are required for AM symbiosis. KIN3 expression is directly regulated by the AP2 transcription factor CTTC MOTIF-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (CBX1), which regulates the reciprocal exchange of nutrients in AM symbiosis, via the AW-box motif in the KIN3 promoter. Loss of function mutations in KIN3, AMK8, or AMK24 result in reduced mycorrhizal colonization in L. japonicus. AMK8 and AMK24 physically interact with KIN3. KIN3 and AMK24 are active kinases and AMK24 directly phosphorylates KIN3 in vitro. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of OsRLCK171, the sole homolog of AMK8 and AMK24 in rice (Oryza sativa), leads to diminished mycorrhization with stunted arbuscules.

The content of saponins, as well as morphological, physiological, and biochemical indicators, were all measured. The UGTs gene related to saponin synthesis was obtained from transcriptome data by homologous comparison, which were used for RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis. Regardless of water, AMF treatment could infect the roots of <i>P. polyphylla</i> var<i>. yunnanensis</i>, however double inoculation with AMF and PGPE (AMF+PGPE) would reduce the infection rate of AMF. Plant height, aboveground and underground fresh weight did not differ significantly between the single inoculation AMF and the double inoculation treatment under different water conditions, but the inoculation treatment significantly increased the plant height of <i>P. polyphylla</i> var<i>. yunnanensis</i> compared to the non-inoculation treatment. Single inoculation with AMF considerably increased the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of <i>P. polyphylla</i> var<i>. yunnanensis</i> leaves under various water conditions, but double inoculation with AMF+PGPE greatly increased the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (Fv/Fm). Under diverse water treatments, single inoculation AMF had the highest proline content, whereas double inoculation AMF+PGPE may greatly improve the amount of abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) compared to normal water under moderate drought. Double inoculation AMF+PGPE treatment improved the proportion of N, P, and K in the rhizome of <i>P. polyphylla</i> var<i>. yunnanensis</i> under various water conditions. Under moderate drought stress, AMF+PGPE significantly enhanced the contents of <i>P. polyphylla</i> var<i>. yunnanensis</i> saponins I, II, VII, and total saponins as compared to normal water circumstances.

Predicting the species-specific ST repertoires can contribute to deciphering the language of communication between organisms of the same or different species. High biochemical plasticity and catalytic promiscuity of sesquiterpene synthases (STSs), however, challenge the homology-based prediction of the STS functions. Using integrated analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, volatilomic, and metabolomic data, we predict product profiles for 116 out of 146 putative STS genes identified in the genomes of 30 fungal species from different trophic groups. Our prediction method is based on the observation that STSs encoded by genes closely related phylogenetically are likely to share the initial enzymatic reactions of the ST biosynthesis pathways and, therefore, produce STs via the same reaction route. The classification by reaction routes allows to assign STs known to be emitted by a particular species to the putative STS genes from this species. Gene expression information helps to further specify these ST-to-STS assignments. Validation of the computational predictions of the STS functions using both in silico and experimental approaches shows that integrated multiomic analyses are able to correctly link cyclic STs of non-cadalane type to genes. In the process of the experimental validation, we characterized catalytic properties of several putative STS genes from the mycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor. We show that the STSs encoded by the L.bicolor mycorrhiza-induced genes emit either nerolidol or -cuprenene and -cuparene, and discuss the possible roles of these STs in the mycorrhiza formation.",36706978

Although previous studies have addressed the possible benefits of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis for rice under salinity stress, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we found that mycorrhizal rice had better shoot and reproductive growth and a significantly higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in the shoot. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity in rice shoots was also improved by AM symbiosis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms required for AM-improved salt tolerance, transcriptome analysis revealing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on the response to AM symbiosis, salinity or specific tissue was performed. Thirteen percent of DEGs showed tissue-preferred responses to both AM symbiosis and salt stress and might be the key genes contributing to AM-enhanced salt tolerance. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified GO terms specifically appearing in this category, including cell wall, oxidoreductase activity, reproduction and ester-related terms. Interestingly, GO terms related to phosphate (Pi) homeostasis were also found, suggesting the possible role of the Pi-related signaling pathway involved in AM-enhanced salt tolerance. Intriguingly, under nonsaline conditions, AM symbiosis influenced the expression of these genes in a similar way as salinity, especially in the shoots.

Common methods used to quantify the mycorrhization of roots are based on microscopic visualization of stained fungal structures within the cortical cells. While this method is readily accessible, it remains time-consuming and does not allow checking of the symbiosis vitality. The aim of this work is thus to develop an efficient method for assessing the intensity and vitality of mycorrhiza associated with grapevine through gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR. To this end, grapevine plants were inoculated with the AMF <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> (Ri).

In the mutualistic endosymbiosis, the AM fungi deliver phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) to the host root through highly branched hyphae called arbuscules. The molecular mechanisms of P<sub>i</sub> transfer from AM fungi to the plant have been determined, which are dominated by AM-specific P<sub>i</sub> transporters belonging to the <u>PH</u>OSPHATE <u>T</u>RANSPORTER <u>1</u> (Pht1) family within the subfamily I. However, it is unknown whether Pht1 family proteins are involved in other regulations in AM symbiosis. Here, we report that the expression of EgPT8 is specifically activated by AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and is localized in root cortical cells containing arbuscules. Interestingly, knockdown of EgPT8 function does not affect the Eucalyptus grandis growth, total phosphorous (P) concentration, and arbuscule formation; however, the size of mature arbuscules was significantly suppressed in the <i>RNAi-EgPT8</i> lines. Heterogeneous expression of <i>EgPT4</i>, <i>EgPT5</i>, and <i>EgPT8</i> in the Medicago truncatula mutant <i>mtpt4-2</i> indicates that <i>EgPT4</i> and <i>EgPT5</i> can fully complement the defects of mutant <i>mtpt4-2</i> in mycorrhizal P<sub>i</sub> uptake and arbuscule formation, while <i>EgPT8</i> cannot complement the defective AM phenotype of the <i>mtpt4-2</i> mutant. Based on our results, we propose that the AM fungi-specific subfamily I transporter EgPT8 has novel functions and is essential to arbuscule elongation. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) formation in host root cortical cells is initiated by exchanges of diffusible molecules, among which P<sub>i</sub> uptake is known as the important feature of AM fungi on symbiosis functioning. Over the last two decades, it has been repeatedly proven that most vascular plants harbor two or more AM-specific Pht1 proteins; however, there is no direct evidence regarding the potential link among these P<sub>i</sub> transporters at the symbiotic interface. This work revealed a novel function of a structurally conserved protein involved in lateral arbuscule development. In total, we confirmed that three AM-specific Pht1 family proteins are nonredundant in Eucalyptus grandis and that EgPT8 is responsible for fungal arbuscule elongation of Rhizophagus irregularis.",36227088

In this study, we used field isolated spores of AM fungi and identified them as Funneliformis geosporum based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses. We separately assembled the genomes of two representative spores using DNA sequences of 19 and 22 individually amplified nuclei. The genomes were compared with previously published data from other members of Glomeraceae including two strains of F. mosseae. No significant differences were observed among the species in terms of gene content, while the single nucleotide polymorphism density was higher in the strains of F. geosporum than in the strains of F. mosseae. In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to sequence and assemble genomes from AM fungal spores sampled in the field, which opens up the possibility to include uncultured AM fungi in phylogenomic and comparative genomic analysis and to study genomic variation in natural populations of these important plant symbionts.",36161535

However, the effectiveness of commercial formulates containing AMF has been questioned. Increasing amounts per plant of one commercial AMF-containing formulate, reported in the text as Myco, were used to detect the effects on growth of tomato plants and the resistance induced against root-knot nematodes (RKNs) The doses used per plant (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 g, reported as Myco1, Myco2, Myco3, respectively) were soil-drenched to growing potted plants; the effects of such treatments were analyzed both in plants not inoculated or inoculated by <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> juveniles. Consistent increases in plant weight were apparent as soon as 7 days only after Myco2 treatments. Moreover, only treatments with Myco2 induced a consistent repression of the nematode infection observed in untreated plants. Conversely, treatments with Myco1 and Myco3 did not produce such an early growth improvement; some plant weight increase was observable only at 28 dpt. Accordingly, such Myco doses did not restrict the level of infestation observed in untreated plants. Control of infection was dependent on the dose of Myco provided to plants five days before nematode inoculation. About one month after all Myco treatments, several areas of roots were found to be colonized by AMF, although in Myco2-treated plants, three genes involved in the AMF colonization process (<i>SlCCaMK</i>, <i>SlLYK9</i>, and <i>SlLYK13</i>) were found to be over-expressed already at 7 dpt; over-expression was generally less consistent at 14 and 21 dpt. The expressions of two key genes of plant defense, the hypersensitive cell death inducer <i>PR4b</i> gene and the glutathione peroxidase-encoding <i>GPX</i> gene, were monitored in roots of Myco2-treated plants 3 and 7 days after nematode inoculation. <i>PR4b</i> was over-expressed and <i>GPX</i> was silenced in treated plants with respect to untreated plants. The repressive effect of Myco2 treatment against RKN infection was completely abolished when Myco2 suspensions were autoclaved to sterilization or treated with the potent anti-fungal agent amphotericin B, thus indicating that the biological control agents contained in the commercial formulate were living fungi.",36012177
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",The mycorrhizal symbiosis alters the plant defence strategy in a model legume plant.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis modulates plant-herbivore interactions. Still, how it shapes the overall plant defence strategy and the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We investigated how AM symbiosis simultaneously modulates plant resistance and tolerance to a shoot herbivore, and explored the underlying mechanisms. Bioassays with Medicago truncatula plants were used to study the effect of the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis on plant resistance and tolerance to Spodoptera exigua herbivory. By performing molecular and chemical analyses, we assessed the impact of AM symbiosis on herbivore-triggered phosphate (Pi)- and jasmonate (JA)-related responses. Upon herbivory, AM symbiosis led to an increased leaf Pi content by boosting the mycorrhizal Pi-uptake pathway. This enhanced both plant tolerance and herbivore performance. AM symbiosis counteracted the herbivore-triggered JA burst, reducing plant resistance. To disentangle the role of the mycorrhizal Pi-uptake pathway in the plant's response to herbivory, we used the mutant line ha1-2, impaired in the H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase gene HA1, which is essential for Pi-uptake via the mycorrhizal pathway. We found that mycorrhiza-triggered enhancement of herbivore performance was compromised in ha1-2 plants. AM symbiosis thus affects the defence pattern of M. truncatula by altering resistance and tolerance simultaneously. We propose that the mycorrhizal Pi-uptake pathway is involved in the modulation of the plant defence strategy.",35982608

In contrast to phosphorus nutrition, the molecular mechanism of mycorrhizal nitrogen (N) uptake remains largely unknown, and its physiological relevance is unclear. Here, we identified a gene encoding an AMF-inducible ammonium transporter, ZmAMT3;1, in maize (Zea mays) roots. ZmAMT3;1 was specifically expressed in arbuscule-containing cortical cells and the encoded protein was localized at the peri-arbuscular membrane. Functional analysis in yeast and Xenopus oocytes indicated that ZmAMT3;1 mediated high-affinity ammonium transport, with the substrate NH4+ being accessed, but likely translocating uncharged NH3. Phosphorylation of ZmAMT3;1 at the C-terminus suppressed transport activity. Using ZmAMT3;1-RNAi transgenic maize lines grown in compartmented pot experiments, we demonstrated that substantial quantities of N were transferred from AMF to plants, and 68%-74% of this capacity was conferred by ZmAMT3;1. Under field conditions, the ZmAMT3;1-dependent mycorrhizal N pathway contributed >30% of postsilking N uptake. Furthermore, AMFs downregulated ZmAMT1;1a and ZmAMT1;3 protein abundance and transport activities expressed in the root epidermis, suggesting a trade-off between mycorrhizal and direct root N-uptake pathways. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive understanding of mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake in maize and present a promising approach to improve N-acquisition efficiency via plant-microbe interactions.",35880836
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Plant Foraging Strategies Driven by Distinct Genetic Modules: Cross-Ecosystem Transcriptomics Approach.,"Plants have evolved diverse strategies for foraging, e.g., mycorrhizae, modification of root system architecture, and secretion of phosphatase. Despite extensive molecular/physiological studies on individual strategies under laboratory/greenhouse conditions, there is little information about how plants orchestrate these strategies in the field. We hypothesized that individual strategies are independently driven by corresponding genetic modules in response to deficiency/unbalance in nutrients. Roots colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, leaves, and root-zone soils were collected from 251 maize plants grown across the United States Corn Belt and Japan, which provided a large gradient of soil characteristics/agricultural practice and thus gene expression for foraging. RNA was extracted from the roots, sequenced, and subjected to gene coexpression network analysis. Nineteen genetic modules were defined and functionally characterized, from which three genetic modules, mycorrhiza formation, phosphate starvation response (PSR), and root development, were selected as those directly involved in foraging. The mycorrhizal module consists of genes responsible for mycorrhiza formation and was upregulated by both phosphorus and nitrogen deficiencies. The PSR module that consists of genes encoding phosphate transporter, secreted acid phosphatase, and enzymes involved in internal-phosphate recycling was regulated independent of the mycorrhizal module and strongly upregulated by phosphorus deficiency relative to nitrogen. The root development module that consists of regulatory genes for root development and cellulose biogenesis was upregulated by phosphorus and nitrogen enrichment. The expression of this module was negatively correlated with that of the mycorrhizal module, suggesting that root development is intrinsically an opposite strategy of mycorrhizae. Our approach provides new insights into understanding plant foraging strategies in complex environments at the molecular level.",35860530
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Clonal spore populations in sporocarps of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.,"Some arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species known to form sporocarps (i.e., aggregations of spores) are polyphyletic in two orders, Glomerales and Diversisporales. Spore clusters (sporocarp-like structures) often formed in pot cultures or in vitro conditions are supposed to be clonal populations, while sporocarps in natural habitats with a fungal peridium are morphologically similar to those of epigeous sexual (zygosporic) sporocarps of Endogone species. Thus, in this study, we explored the genetics of sporocarpic spores of two AM fungi with a view to possibilities of clonal or sexual reproduction during sporocarps formation. To examine these possibilities, we investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in reduced genomic libraries of spores isolated from sporocarps molecularly identified as Rhizophagus irregularis and Diversispora epigaea. In addition, partial sequences of the MAT locus HD2 gene of R. irregularis were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the nuclear status of the spores. We found that most SNPs were shared among the spores isolated from each sporocarp in both species. Furthermore, all HD2 sequences from spores isolated from three R. irregularis sporocarps were identical. These results indicate that those sporocarps comprise clonal spores. Therefore, sporocarps with clonal spores may have different functions than sexual reproduction, such as massive spore production or spore dispersal via mycophagy.",35767052

In the <i>Ossyp131b Ossyp132</i> double mutants, however, the colonization rate and arbuscule abundance level decreased markedly, indicating an impaired fungal proliferation ability in rice roots. Such a defect was further confirmed by the reduced expression levels of AM marker genes. Our results in rice therefore demonstrated that while SYP13II members showed evolutionary and induction patterns specific to symbiosis, AM symbiosis is in fact controlled by the combined action of both SYP13I and SYP13II clades, revealing a functional redundancy among SYNTAXIN genes in mutualism.",35665185

They enhance the ability of their host to obtain nutrients from the soil and increase the tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors. However, AM fungal species can differ in the benefits they provide to their host plants. Here, we examined the putative molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the physiological response of Medicago truncatula to colonization by Rhizophagus irregularis or Glomus aggregatum, which have previously been characterized as high- and low-benefit AM fungal species, respectively. Colonization with R. irregularis led to greater growth and nutrient uptake than colonization with G. aggregatum. These benefits were linked to an elevated expression in the roots of strigolactone biosynthesis genes (NSP1, NSP2, CCD7, and MAX1a), mycorrhiza-induced phosphate (PT8), ammonium (AMT2;3), and nitrate (NPF4.12) transporters and the putative ammonium transporter NIP1;5. R. irregularis also stimulated the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in the shoot and the upregulation of the sugar transporters SWEET1.2, SWEET3.3, and SWEET 12 and the lipid biosynthesis gene RAM2 in the roots. In contrast, G. aggregatum induced the expression of biotic stress defense response genes in the shoots, and several genes associated with abiotic stress in the roots. This suggests that either the host perceives colonization by G. aggregatum as pathogen attack or that G. aggregatum can prime host defense responses. Our findings highlight molecular mechanisms that host plants may use to regulate their association with high- and low-benefit arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts.",35511363

While such analyses are widespread in well-characterized groups of species, they are much more challenging in groups for which diversity is mostly known through molecular techniques. Here, we use the largest global database on the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Glomeromycotina, a subphylum of microscopic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that provide mineral nutrients to most land plants by forming one of the oldest terrestrial symbioses, to analyse the diversification dynamics of this clade in the past 500million years. We perform a range of sensitivity analyses and simulations to control for potential biases linked to the nature of the data. We find that Glomeromycotina tend to have low speciation rates compared to other eukaryotes. After a peak of speciations between 200 and 100million years ago, they experienced an important decline in speciation rates toward the present. Such a decline could be at least partially related to a shrinking of their mycorrhizal niches and to their limited ability to colonize new niches. Our analyses identify patterns of diversification in a group of obligate symbionts of major ecological and evolutionary importance and illustrate that short molecular markers combined with intensive sensitivity analyses can be useful for studying diversification dynamics in microbial groups.",35451535

We sequenced and compared the genomes of seven species of milk-cap fungi (Lactarius, Russulales) with contrasting host specificity. We also compared these genomes with those of symbiotic and saprotrophic Russulales species, aiming to identify genes involved in their ecology and host specificity. The size of Lactarius genomes is significantly larger than other Russulales species, owing to a massive accumulation of transposable elements and duplication of dispensable genes. As expected, their repertoire of genes coding for plant cell wall-degrading enzymes is restricted, but they retained a substantial set of genes involved in microbial cell wall degradation. Notably, Lactarius species showed a striking expansion of genes encoding proteases, such as secreted ectomycorrhiza-induced sedolisins. A high copy number of genes coding for small secreted LysM proteins and Lactarius-specific lectins were detected, which may be linked to host specificity.

The Lotus japonicus T-DNA insertion line T90, carrying a promoterless uidA (GUS) gene in the promoter of Calcium Binding Protein 1 (CBP1) is exceptional as it exhibits GUS activity in both root endosymbioses. To identify the responsible cis- and trans-acting factors, we subjected deletion/modification series of CBP1 promoter:reporter fusions to transactivation and spatio-temporal expression analysis and screened ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-mutagenized T90 populations for aberrant GUS expression. We identified one cis-regulatory element required for GUS expression in the epidermis and a second element, necessary and sufficient for transactivation by the calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) in combination with the transcription factor Cyclops and conferring gene expression during both AM and RNS. Lack of GUS expression in T90 white mutants could be traced to DNA hypermethylation detected in and around this element.

Expression of ZmHMA5a and ZmHMA5b, whose encoded proteins were predicted to be localized at the plasma membrane, was up-regulated by Cu in non-mycorrhizal roots and to a lower extent in mycorrhizal roots. Gene expression of the tonoplast ZmHMA3a and ZmHMA4 isoforms was up-regulated by Cu-toxicity in shoots and roots of mycorrhizal plants. AM mitigates the changes induced by Cu toxicity on the maize ionome, specially at the highest Cu soil concentration.

Because earlier studies have reported niche conservatism in AM fungi, we hypothesized that variation in taxonomic community composition (i.e.,unweighted by taxon relatedness) should resemble variation in phylogenetic community composition (i.e., weighted by taxon relatedness) which reflects ancestral adaptations to historical habitat gradients. Because of the presumed strong dispersal ability of AM fungi, we also anticipated that the large-scale structure of AM fungal communities would track environmental conditions without regional discontinuity. We used recently published AM fungal sequence data (small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene) from soil samples collected worldwide to reconstruct global patterns in taxonomic and phylogenetic community variation. The taxonomic structure of AM fungal communities was primarily driven by habitat conditions, with limited regional differentiation, and there were two well-supported clusters of communities - occurring in cold and warm conditions. Phylogenetic structure was driven by the same factors, though all relationships were markedly weaker. This suggests that niche conservatism with respect to habitat associations is weakly expressed in AM fungal communities.

By obtaining OsADK1pro::GUS transgenic rice plants and also generating Osadk1 mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 technique, OsADK1 was revealed to be specifically induced in the arbusculated cortical cells and mutations in OsADK1 resulted in an extremely low colonisation rate (c. 3%) of rice roots by AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. In the mutant roots, the very few observed arbuscules nearly all arrested at an early 'trunk-forming' phase without forming any branches. Increasing the inoculum strength of AM fungus or cocultivation with a wild-type nurse plant did not result in the rescue of the arbuscule phenotype. Transcriptome sequencing of both nursed and un-nursed Osadk1 mutants then revealed that the mutation of OsADK1 could greatly affect the AM symbiotic programme, including many key transcription factors such as RAM1 and WRI5.

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE transcription factors enable arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis.,"Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is a widespread symbiosis between roots of the majority of land plants and Glomeromycotina fungi. AM is important for ecosystem health and functioning as the fungi critically support plant performance by providing essential mineral nutrients, particularly the poorly accessible phosphate, in exchange for organic carbon. AM fungi colonize the inside of roots and this is promoted at low but inhibited at high plant phosphate status, while the mechanistic basis for this phosphate-dependence remained obscure. Here we demonstrate that a major transcriptional regulator of phosphate starvation responses in rice PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2 (PHR2) regulates AM. Root colonization of phr2 mutants is drastically reduced, and PHR2 is required for root colonization, mycorrhizal phosphate uptake, and yield increase in field soil. PHR2 promotes AM by targeting genes required for pre-contact signaling, root colonization, and AM function. Thus, this important symbiosis is directly wired to the PHR2-controlled plant phosphate starvation response.",35078978

Proper functioning of EcM fungi implies the differentiation of structures within the fungal colony. A symbiotic structure is dedicated to nutrient exchange and the extramatricular mycelium explores soil for nutrients. Eventually, basidiocarps develop to assure last stages of sexual reproduction. The aim of this study is to understand how an EcM fungus uses its gene set to support functional differentiation and development of specialized morphological structures. We examined the transcriptomes of <i>Laccaria bicolor</i> under a series of experimental setups, including the growth with <i>Populus tremula x alba</i> at different developmental stages, basidiocarps and free-living mycelium, under various conditions of N, P and C supply. In particular, N supply induced global transcriptional changes, whereas responses to P supply seemed to be independent from it. Symbiosis development with poplar is characterized by transcriptional waves. Basidiocarp development shares transcriptional signatures with other basidiomycetes. Overlaps in transcriptional responses of <i>L. bicolor</i> hyphae to a host plant and N/C supply next to co-regulation of genes in basidiocarps and mature mycorrhiza were detected. Few genes are induced in a single condition only, but functional and morphological differentiation rather involves fine tuning of larger gene sets. Overall, this transcriptomic atlas builds a reference to study the function and stability of EcM symbiosis in distinct conditions using <i>L. bicolor</i> as a model and indicates both similarities and differences with other ectomycorrhizal fungi, allowing researchers to distinguish conserved processes such as basidiocarp development from nutrient homeostasis.",34946213

The symbiosis is based upon bidirectional nutrient exchange between the host and symbiont that occurs between inner cortical cells of the root and branched AM hyphae called arbuscules that develop within these cells. Lipid transport and its regulation during the symbiosis have been intensively investigated in dicotyledon plants, especially legumes. Here, we characterize <i>OsRAM2</i> and <i>OsRAM2L</i>, homologs of <i>Medicago truncatula RAM2,</i> and found that plants defective in <i>OsRAM2</i> were unable to be colonized by AM fungi and showed impaired colonization by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. The induction of <i>OsRAM2</i> and <i>OsRAM2L</i> is dependent on <i>OsRAM1</i> and the common symbiosis signaling pathway pathway genes <i>CCaMK</i> and <i>CYCLOPS</i>, while overexpression of <i>OsRAM1</i> results in increased expression of <i>OsRAM2</i> and <i>OsRAM2L</i>. Collectively, our data show that the function and regulation of <i>OsRAM2</i> is conserved in monocot and dicot plants and reveals that, similar to mutualistic fungi, pathogenic fungi have recruited RAM2-mediated fatty acid biosynthesis to facilitate invasion.[Formula: see text] Copyright  2022 The Author(s).

The past decade has witnessed significant progress in understanding and advances on GRAS transcription factors in various plants. A notable concern is to what extent the mechanisms found in plants, particularly crops, are shared by other species, and what other characteristics are dependent on GRAS transcription factor (TFS)-mediated gene expression. GRAS are involved in many processes that are intimately linked to plant growth regulation. However, GRAS also perform additional roles against environmental stresses, allowing plants to function more efficiently. GRAS increase plant growth and development by improving several physiological processes, such as phytohormone, biosynthetic and signalling pathways. Furthermore, the GRAS gene family plays an important role in response to abiotic stresses, e.g. photooxidative stress. Moreover, evidence shows the involvement of GRAS in arbuscule development during plant-mycorrhiza associations. In this review, the diverse roles of GRAS in plant systems are highlighted that could be useful in enhancing crop productivity through genetic modification, especially of crops. This is the first review to report the role and function of the GRAS gene family in plant systems.

This study examined the growth-promoting effects and mechanisms of pine growth after inoculation with the MHB Bacillus pumilus HR10 and/or Hymenochaete sp. Rl. The effect of B. pumilus HR10 on Hymenochaete sp. Rl growth, enzyme activity and gene expression related to mycorrhiza formation were determined. The growth, root activity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content and chlorophyll fluorescence activity of Pinus thunbergii and the mycorrhizal colonization intensity of Hymenochaete sp. Rl-inoculated pine seedlings after inoculation with B. pumilus HR10 were also evaluated. The results showed that B. pumilus HR10 promoted growth, regulated the expression of mycorrhizal-related genes and affected the -1,3-glucanase activity of Hymenochaete sp. Rl. The mycorrhizal colonization intensity of pine seedlings co-inoculated with B. pumilus HR10 and Hymenochaete sp. Rl was 1.58-fold higher than seedlings inoculated with only Hymenochaete sp. Rl. Inoculation with B. pumilus HR10 and/or Hymenochaete sp. Rl increased lateral root number and root activity of pine seedlings and chlorophyll fluorescence activity of pine needles compared with the control. Bacillus pumilus HR10 facilitated nutrient uptake by enhancing the mycorrhizal proliferation of pine and induced greater photosynthesis and root activity of pine seedlings, which confirms its role as an outstanding plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium.

One of these changes is the accommodation in the cortex of hyperbranched hyphae of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, called arbuscules.

Although several scholars have attempted to isolate and cultivate fungal strains, no accurate method for culture of artificial fruiting bodies has been presented owing to difficulties associated with mycelium growth on artificial media. Herein, we sequenced R. griseocarnosa genome using the second- and third-generation sequencing technologies, followed by de novo assembly of high-throughput sequencing reads, and GeneMark-ES, BLAST, CAZy, and other databases were utilized for functional gene annotation. We also constructed a phylogenetic tree using different species of fungi, and also conducted comparative genomics analysis of R. griseocarnosa against its four representative species. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of one already sequenced genome of R. griseocarnosa based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing of that type of species. The assembly process resulted in identification of 230 scaffolds with a total genome size of 50.67 Mbp. The gene prediction showed that R. griseocarnosa genome included 14,229 coding sequences (CDs). In addition, 470 RNAs were predicted with 155 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 49 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 41 small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs), 42 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and 183 microRNAs (miRNAs). The predicted protein sequences of R. griseocarnosa were analyzed to indicate the existence of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and the results revealed that 153 genes encoded CAZymes, which were distributed in 58 CAZyme families. These enzymes included 78 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 34 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 30 auxiliary activities (AAs), 2 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 8 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), and only one polysaccharide lyase (PL). Compared with other fungi, R. griseocarnosa had fewer CAZymes, and the number and distribution of CAZymes were similar to other mycorrhizal fungi, such as Tricholoma matsutake and Suillus luteus. Well-defined effector proteins that were associated with mycorrhiza-induced small-secreted proteins (MiSSPs) were not found in R. griseocarnosa, which indicated that there may be some special effector proteins to interact with host plants in R. griseocarnosa.

The present study aimed to analyze the effect of Funneliformis mosseae (Nicol. & Gerd.) Schler & Walker on the circadian clock gene expression patterns in trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) along with gas exchange, abscisic acid (ABA) levels and antioxidant enzyme gene expression under well-watered (WW) and drought stress (DS) conditions. Plant growth, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and ABA levels were significantly higher in AMF- than in non-AMF-inoculated plants regardless of soil water regimes. Six circadian clock genes, including PtPRR7, PtLHY, PtCCA1, PtGI, PtPIF3 and PtSRR1, were identified and showed rhythmic expression patterns over the course of the day. The AMF inoculation reduced the expression of most circadian clock genes in different time periods. However, AMF treatment significantly increased PtPRR7 and PtGI expression at 5:00p.m. under WW and DS conditions, PtLHY expression at 1:00a.m. and PtSRR1 expression at 9:00p.m. At 1:00a.m., AMF inoculation up-regulated the expression of the circadian clock genes PtPRR7, PtCCA1, PtLHY and PtPIF3 and the antioxidant enzyme genes PtFe-SOD, PtMn-SOD, PtCu/Zn-SOD, PtPOD and PtCAT1.

Our study was carried out to assess the effects of exogenous EE-GRSP and DE-GRSP at varying strengths on plant growth and chlorophyll concentration of trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) seedlings, along with changes in root nutrient acquisition, auxin content, auxin-related enzyme and transporter protein gene expression, and element contents of purified GRSP. Sixteen weeks later, exogenous GRSP displayed differential effects on plant growth (height, stem diameter, leaf number, and biomass production): the increase by EE-GRSP and the decrease by DE-GRSP. The best positive effect on plant growth occurred at exogenous EE-GRSP at  strength. Similarly, the GRSP application also differently affected total chlorophyll content, root morphology (total length, surface area, and volume), and root N, P, and K content: positive effect by EE-GRSP and negative effect by DE-GRSP. Exogenous EE-GRSP accumulated more indoleacetic acid (IAA) in roots, which was associated with the upregulated expression of root auxin synthetic enzyme genes (<i>PtTAA1, PtYUC3</i>, and <i>PtYUC4</i>) and auxin influx transporter protein genes (<i>PtLAX1, PtLAX2</i>, and <i>PtLAX3</i>). On the other hand, exogenous DE-GRSP inhibited root IAA and indolebutyric acid (IBA) content, associated with the downregulated expression of root <i>PtTAA1, PtLAX1</i>, and <i>PtLAX3</i>. Root IAA positively correlated with root <i>PtTAA1, PtYUC3, PtYUC4, PtLAX1</i>, and <i>PtLAX3</i> expression. Purified EE-GRSP and DE-GRSP showed similar element composition but varied in part element (C, O, P, Ca, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, and Mo) concentration. It concluded that exogenous GRSP triggered differential effects on growth response, and the effect was associated with the element content of pure GRSP and the change in auxins and root morphology.

Here, we characterized the symbiotic transcriptomes of several milkcap species (<i>Lactarius</i>, Russulales) in association with different pine hosts. A time-course study of changes in gene expression during the development of <i>L. deliciosus-Pinus taeda</i> symbiosis identified 6 to 594 differentially expressed fungal genes at various developmental stages.

A high number of genes coding for secreted proteases, especially sedolisins, were induced during root colonization. In contrast, only a few genes encoding mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins were identified. This feature was confirmed in several other <i>Lactarius</i> species in association with various pines. Further comparison among all these species revealed that each <i>Lactarius</i> species encodes a highly specific symbiotic gene repertoire, a feature possibly related to their host-specificity.

The transcriptomics and rhizosphere fungal diversity of blueberry were analyzed, and the iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) content of blueberry tissues, soil and DGT was determined. A correlation analysis was also performed. A total of 84 374 annotated genes were identified in the root, stem, leaf and fruit tissue of blueberry, of which 3370 were DEGs, and in stem tissue, of which 2521 were DEGs. The annotation data showed that these DEGs were mainly concentrated in a series of metabolic pathways related to signal transduction, defense and the plant-pathogen response. Blueberry transferred excess Cd from the root to the stem for storage, and the highest levels of Cd were found in stem tissue, consistent with the results of transcriptome analysis, while the lowest Cd concentration occurred in the fruit, Cd also inhibited the absorption of other metal elements by blueberry. A series of genes related to Cd regulation were screened by analyzing the correlation between heavy metal content and transcriptome results. The roots of blueberry rely on mycorrhiza to absorb nutrients from the soil. The presence of Cd has a significant effect on the microbial community composition of the blueberry rhizosphere. The fungal family Coniochaetaceae, which is extremely extremelytolerant, has gradually become the dominant population.

The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi symbiotic associations in cereal crops are known to regulate growth in cultivar-specific manner and induce phosphate (Pi) transporters (PHT1) in roots. In the present study, we observed that both AM colonization of roots by Glomus species and phosphate starvation enhanced phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in barley seedlings. Our search for the full complement of PHT1 members in the recently sequenced barley genome identified six additional genes, totaling their number to 17. Both AM colonization and Pi starvation triggered activation of common as well as different PHT1s. Pi starvation led to the robust upregulation of HvPHT1;6.2/6.3 at 7d and weak activation of HvPHT1;1 in shoots at 3d time-point. In roots, only HvPHT1;1, HvPHT1;6.2/6.3, HvPHT1;7, HvPHT1;8, HvPHT1;11.2 and HvPHT12 were induced at least one of the time-points. AM colonization specifically upregulated HvPHT1;11, HvPHT1;11.2, HvPHT1;12 and HvPHT1;13.1/13.2, members belonging to subfamily II, in roots. Sucrose availability seems to be obligatory for the robust activation of HvPHT1;1 as unavailability of this metabolite generally weakened its upregulation under Pi starvation. Intriguingly, lack of sucrose supply also led to induction of HvPHT1;5, HvPHT1;8, and HvPHT1;11.2 in either roots or shoot or both. The mRNA levels of HvPHT1;5 and HvPHT1;11.2 were not severely affected under combined deficiency of Pi and sucrose.

Mycorrhized host, non-mycorrhized host and non-host cultivars of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were subjected to RNA seq analysis. The top 10 differentially expressed genes were subjected to extensive in silico phylogenetic analysis along with 10 more candidate genes that have been previously reported for AM-plant interactions.

Based on the results, candidate genes were categorized as highly influenced (SYMRK and CCaMK), moderately influenced and minimally influenced by evolutionary constraints. We propose that the amino acid and nucleotide changes specific to non-hosts are likely to correspond to aberrations in functionality towards AM symbiosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the host plant responses to <i>Serendipita</i> spp. colonization by characterizing the switchgrass root transcriptome during different stages of symbiosis invitro. For this, we included a native switchgrass strain, <i>Serendipita bescii</i>, and a related strain, <i>S. vermifera</i>, isolated from Australian orchids. <i>Serendipita</i> colonization progresses from thin hyphae that grow between root cells to, finally, the production of large, bulbous hyphae that fill root cells during the later stages of colonization. We report that switchgrass seems to perceive both fungi prior to physical contact, leading to the activation of chemical and structural defense responses and putative host disease resistance genes. Subsequently, the host defense system appears to be quenched and carbohydrate metabolism adjusted, potentially to accommodate the fungal symbiont. In addition, prior to contact, switchgrass exhibited significant increases in root hair density and root surface area. Furthermore, genes involved in phytohormone metabolism such as gibberellin, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid were activated during different stages of colonization. Both fungal strains induced plant gene expression in a similar manner, indicating a conserved plant response to members of this fungal order.

The model AMF Rhizophagus irregularis is common in many ecosystems and naturally forms homokaryons and dikaryons. Quantitative variation in allele frequencies in clonally dikaryon offspring suggests they disproportionately inherit two distinct nuclear genotypes from their parent. This is interesting, because such progeny strongly and differentially affect plant growth. Neither the frequency and magnitude of this occurrence nor its effect on gene transcription are known. Using reduced representation genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and quantitative analysis tools, we show that progeny of homokaryons and dikaryons are qualitatively genetically identical to the parent. However, dikaryon progeny differ quantitatively due to unequal inheritance of nuclear genotypes. Allele frequencies of actively transcribed biallelic genes resembled the frequencies of the two nuclear genotypes. More biallelic genes showed transcription of both alleles than monoallelic transcription, but biallelic transcription was less likely with greater allelic divergence. Monoallelic transcription levels of biallelic genes were reduced compared with biallelic gene transcription, a finding consistent with genomic conflict.

Previous legume studies showed that the <i>required for arbuscular mycorrhization2</i> (<i>RAM2</i>) gene is necessary for transferring lipids from plants to AM fungi (AMF) and is also likely to play a ""signaling"" role at the root surface. To further explore <i>RAM2</i> functions in other plant lineages, in this study, two rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes, <i>OsRAM2</i> and <i>OsRAM2L</i>, were identified as orthologs of legume <i>RAM2</i>. Examining their expression patterns during symbiosis revealed that only <i>OsRAM2</i> was strongly upregulated upon AMF inoculation.

After inoculation by AMF <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> or <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i>, all of the mutant lines showed extremely low colonization rates and the rarely observed arbuscules were all defective, thus supporting a conserved ""nutritional"" role of <i>RAM2</i> between monocot and dicot lineages. As for the signaling role, although the hyphopodia numbers formed by both AMF on <i>Osram2</i> mutants were indeed reduced, their morphology showed no abnormality, with fungal hyphae invading roots successfully. Promoter activities further indicated that <i>OsRAM2</i> was not expressed in epidermal cells below hyphopodia or outer cortical cells enclosing fungal hyphae but instead expressed exclusively in cortical cells containing arbuscules. Therefore, this suggested an indirect role of <i>RAM2</i> rather than a direct involvement in determining the symbiosis signals at the root surface.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 ""No Rights Reserved"" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law, 2022.",34077267
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Phosphate Suppression of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis Involves Gibberellic Acid Signaling.,"Most land plants entertain a mutualistic symbiosis known as arbuscular mycorrhiza with fungi (Glomeromycota) that provide them with essential mineral nutrients, in particular phosphate (Pi), and protect them from biotic and abiotic stress. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis increases plant productivity and biodiversity and is therefore relevant for both natural plant communities and crop production. However, AM fungal populations suffer from intense farming practices in agricultural soils, in particular Pi fertilization. The dilemma between natural fertilization from AM symbiosis and chemical fertilization has raised major concern and emphasizes the need to better understand the mechanisms by which Pi suppresses AM symbiosis. Here, we test the hypothesis that Pi may interfere with AM symbiosis via the phytohormone gibberellic acid (GA) in the Solanaceous model systems Petunia hybrida and Nicotiana tabacum. Indeed, we find that GA is inhibitory to AM symbiosis and that Pi may cause GA levels to increase in mycorrhizal roots. Consistent with a role of endogenous GA as an inhibitor of AM development, GA-defective N. tabacum lines expressing a GA-metabolizing enzyme (GA methyltransferase-GAMT) are colonized more quickly by the AM fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare, and exogenous Pi is less effective in inhibiting AM colonization in these lines. Systematic gene expression analysis of GA-related genes reveals a complex picture, in which GA degradation by GA2 oxidase plays a prominent role. These findings reveal potential targets for crop breeding that could reduce Pi suppression of AM symbiosis, thereby reconciling the advantages of Pi fertilization with the diverse benefits of AM symbiosis.",34037236

This experimental design, coupled with 18S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing, allowed us to test the influence of maize and its genotype on the rhizosphere's eukaryotic community.

Various genera of nematodes and fungi, predominantly bacterial feeding nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi among other taxa, were increased in the rhizosphere samples. We also observed that maize genotype differentially shaped the relative abundance of the following fungal families in the rhizosphere: Acaulosporaceae, Aspergillaceae, Chaetomiaceae, Claroideoglomeraceae, Corticiaceae, Mortierellaceae, Trichocomaceae and Trichomeriaceae.

Treatment of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) with the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) Azospirillum brasilense and Pseudomonas simiae indicated a role for the PP2A B' subunit in responses to PGPR. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influenced B' transcript levels in soil-grown plants with canonical arbuscular mycorrhizae.

In transformed tomato plants with 10-fold enhanced B' expression, mycorrhization frequency was decreased in vermiculite-grown plants. Furthermore, the high B' expression was related to abscisic acid and gibberellic acid responses known to be involved in plant growth and mycorrhization. B' overexpressor plants showed less vigorous growth, and although fruits were normal size, the number of seeds per fruit was reduced by 60% compared to the original cultivar. Expression of the B' gene in tomato roots is strongly influenced by beneficial microbes. Analysis of B' overexpressor tomato plants and established tomato cultivars substantiated a function of B' in growth and development in addition to a role in mycorrhization.",33863284

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i>, on H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, and gene expression of trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) seedlings subjected to well-watered (WW) and drought stress (DS), together with the changes in leaf gas exchange, root morphology, soil pH value, and ammonium content. Soil drought treatment dramatically increased H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity of leaf and root, and AMF inoculation further strengthened the increased effect. A plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene of trifoliate orange, PtAHA2 (MW239123), was cloned. The <i>PtAHA2</i> expression was induced by mycorrhization in leaves and roots and also up-regulated by drought treatment in leaves of AMF-inoculated seedlings and in roots of AMF- and non-AMF-inoculated seedlings. And, the induced expression of <i>PtAHA2</i> under mycorrhization was more prominent under DS than under WW. Mycorrhizal plants also showed greater photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and transpiration rate and better root volume and diameter than non-mycorrhizal plants under DS. AMF inoculation significantly increased leaf and root ammonium content, especially under DS, whereas it dramatically reduced soil pH value. In addition, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity was significantly positively correlated with ammonium contents in leaves and roots, and root H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity was significantly negatively correlated with soil pH value. Our results concluded that AMF stimulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and <i>PtAHA2</i> gene expression in response to DS, which resulted in great nutrient (e.g., ammonium) uptake and root growth, as well as low soil pH microenvironment.",33841484

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been considered as one of the promising plant biocontrol agents in preventing from root pathogens. This study examined the effect of AM fungal inoculation on plant growth and differential expressions of growth- and defense-related genes in banana seedlings. Tissue-cultured seedlings of Brazilian banana (<i>Musa acuminate</i> Cavendish cv. Brail) were inoculated with AM fungus (<i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i>, Ri), and developed good mycorrhizal symbiosis from 4 to 11 weeks after inoculation with an infection rate up to 71.7% of the roots system. Microbial abundance revealed that Ri abundance in banana roots was 1.8510<sup>6</sup> copies/ml at 11 weeks after inoculaiton. Inoculation improved plant dry weights by 47.5, 124, and 129% for stem, leaf, and the whole plant, respectively, during phosphate depletion. Among a total of 1411 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from the transcriptome data analysis, genes related to plant resistance (e.g. POD, PAL, PYR, and HBP-1b) and those related to plant growth (e.g. IAA, GH3, SAUR, and ARR8) were up-regulated in AM plants. This study demonstrates that AM fungus effectively promoted the growth of banana plants and induced defense-related genes which could help suppress wilt disease. The outcomes of this study form a basis for further study on the mechanism of banana disease resistance induced by AM fungi.",33793381

Here, we report on the importance of basidiospore inocula for this fungus to provide ectomycorrhizal seedlings in vitro. Ectomycorrhizal pine seedlings synthesized in vitro with cultured mycelium of T. matsutake (isolate #45 or #84) in a 250-mL culture vessel (soil volume) were transplanted to a large 1-L culture vessel. Fresh basidiospores of this fungus were aseptically inoculated on the ectomycorrhizal root system. The ectomycorrhizal seedlings in the 1-L vessel were grown for 9 months, and some plants were further grown for 6 more months under non-aseptic conditions in 4.1-L jars. The ectomycorrhizal seedlings previously inoculated with isolate #84 in the 1-L vessel showed significant ectomycorrhizal biomass (mycorrhizal root length) after spore inoculation. The ectomycorrhizal seedlings in the 4.1-L vessel showed large shiro structures (> 10 cm in diameter). PCR amplification of intergenic spacer 1 of the rRNA gene and long terminal repeat retroelement of T. matsutake in ectomycorrhizal root tips in both the 1-L vessels and 4.1-L jars revealed the presence of amplicons of the previously inoculated culture isolate of T. matsutake and the new genet(s) that established via germination of the inoculated basidiospores.

This symbiosis is mutually beneficial, as AM fungi feed on plant photosynthesis products, in turn improving the efficiency of nutrient uptake from the environment. The garden pea (Pisum sativum L.), a widely cultivated crop and an important model for genetics, is capable of forming triple symbiotic systems consisting of the plant, AM fungi and nodule bacteria. As transcriptomic and proteomic approaches are being implemented for studying the mutualistic symbioses of pea, a need for a reference transcriptome of genes expressed under these specific conditions for increasing the resolution and the accuracy of other methods arose. Numerous transcriptome assemblies constructed for pea did not include mycorrhizal roots, hence the aim of the study to construct a reference transcriptome assembly of pea mycorrhizal roots. The combined transcriptome of mycorrhizal roots of Pisum sativum cv. Frisson inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis BEG144 was investigated, and for both the organisms independent transcriptomes were assembled (coverage 177x for pea and 45x for fungus). Genes specific to mycorrhizal roots were found in the assembly, their expression patterns were examined with qPCR on two pea cultivars, Frisson and Finale. The gene expression depended on the inoculation stage and on the pea cultivar.

Understanding the composition of AMF communities in tropical areas gains special relevance as crop productivity in typically low fertility tropical soils can be improved with the use of AMF. We used a hierarchical sampling approach in which we sampled soil from cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) plantations nested in localities, and in which localities were nested within each of three regions of Cte d'Ivoire. This sampling strategy, combined with 18S rRNA gene sequencing and a dedicated de novo OTU-picking model, allowed us to study AMF community composition and how it is influenced at different geographical scales and across environmental gradients. Several factors, including pH, influenced overall AMF alpha diversity and differential abundance of specific taxa and families of the Glomeromycotina. Assemblages and diversity metrics at the local scale did not reliably predict those at regional scales. The amount of variation explained by soil, climate, and geography variables left a large proportion of the variance to be explained by other processes, likely happening at smaller scales than the ones considered in this study. Gaining a better understanding of processes involved in shaping tropical AMF community composition and AMF establishment are much needed and could allow for the development of sustainable, productive tropical agroecosystems.",33638731

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",A nuclear-targeted effector of Rhizophagus irregularis interferes with histone 2B mono-ubiquitination to promote arbuscular mycorrhisation.,"Arguably, symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have the broadest host range of all fungi, being able to intracellularly colonise root cells in the vast majority of all land plants. This raises the question how AM fungi effectively deal with the immune systems of such a widely diverse range of plants. Here, we studied the role of a nuclear-localisation signal-containing effector from Rhizophagus irregularis, called Nuclear Localised Effector1 (RiNLE1), that is highly and specifically expressed in arbuscules. We showed that RiNLE1 is able to translocate to the host nucleus where it interacts with the plant core nucleosome protein histone 2B (H2B). RiNLE1 is able to impair the mono-ubiquitination of H2B, which results in the suppression of defence-related gene expression and enhanced colonisation levels. This study highlights a novel mechanism by which AM fungi can effectively control plant epigenetic modifications through direct interaction with a core nucleosome component. Homologues of RiNLE1 are found in a range of fungi that establish intimate interactions with plants, suggesting that this type of effector may be more widely recruited to manipulate host defence responses.",33507543
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Relative qPCR to quantify colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.,"Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) are beneficial soil fungi that can promote the growth of their host plants. Accurate quantification of AMF in plant roots is important because the level of colonization is often indicative of the activity of these fungi. Root colonization is traditionally measured with microscopy methods which visualize fungal structures inside roots. Microscopy methods are labor-intensive, and results depend on the observer. In this study, we present a relative qPCR method to quantify AMFin which we normalized the AMF qPCR signal relative to a plant gene. First, we validated the primer pair AMG1F and AM1 in silico, and we show that these primers cover most AMF species present in plant roots without amplifying host DNA. Next, we compared the relative qPCR method with traditional microscopy based on a greenhouse experiment with Petunia plants that ranged from very high to very low levels of AMF root colonization. Finally, by sequencing the qPCR amplicons with MiSeq, we experimentally confirmed that the primer pair excludes plant DNA while amplifying mostly AMF. Most importantly, our relative qPCR approach was capable of discriminating quantitative differences in AMF root colonization and it strongly correlated (Spearman Rho=0.875) with quantifications by traditional microscopy. Finally, we provide a balanced discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of microscopy and qPCR methods. In conclusion, the tested approach of relative qPCR presents a reliable alternative method to quantify AMF root colonization that is less operator-dependent than traditional microscopy and offers scalability to high-throughput analyses.",33475800

These morphological modifications are associated with cytoskeleton remodelling. However, molecular bases and the role of microtubules (MTs) and actin filament dynamics during AM formation are largely unknown. In this study, the tomato tsb (tomato similar to SB401) gene, belonging to a Solanaceae group of genes encoding MT-associated proteins (MAPs) for pollen development, was found to be highly expressed in root cells containing arbuscules. At earlier stages of mycorrhizal development, tsb overexpression enhanced the formation of highly developed and transcriptionally active arbuscules, while tsb silencing hampers the formation of mature arbuscules and represses arbuscule functionality. However, at later stages of mycorrhizal colonization, tsb overexpressing (OE) roots accumulate fully developed transcriptionally inactive arbuscules, suggesting that the collapse and turnover of arbuscules might be impaired by TSB accumulation. Imaging analysis of the MT cytoskeleton in cortex root cells OE tsb revealed that TSB is involved in MT bundling.

Factors including viral RNA accumulation and expression of Pathogenesis Related proteins (PR) coding genes including <i>PR1</i>, <i>PR2</i>, and <i>PR3</i> in the young leaves were measured. For TBSV, a lower level of virus accumulation and a higher expression of PR genes in MV plants were observed compared to V and VM plants.

Currently, the role of AS in symbioses formed by plants with soil microorganisms is not fully understood. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome of garden pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i> L.) roots in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhiza was performed using RNAseq and following bioinformatic analysis. AS profiles of mycorrhizal and control roots were highly similar, intron retention accounting for a large proportion of the observed AS types (67%). Using three different tools (SUPPA2, DRIMSeq and IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR), eight genes with AS events specific for mycorrhizal roots of pea were identified, among which four were annotated as encoding an apoptosis inhibitor protein, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, a dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, and a pre-mRNA-splicing factor ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAH1. In pea mycorrhizal roots, the isoforms of these four genes with preliminary stop codons leading to a truncated ORFs were up-regulated.

We addressed this phenomenon by using AM-defective vapyrin (vpy) mutants in Petunia hybrida, including a new allele (vpy-3) with a transposon insertion close to the ATG start codon. We explore whether abortion of fungal infection in vpy mutants is associated with the induction of defence markers, such as cell wall alterations, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), defence hormones and induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. We show that vpy mutants exhibit a strong resistance against intracellular colonization, which is associated with the generation of cell wall appositions (papillae) with lignin impregnation at fungal entry sites, while no accumulation of defence hormones, ROS or callose was observed. Systematic analysis of PR gene expression revealed that several PR genes are induced in mycorrhizal roots of the wild-type, and even more in vpy plants.

Different signaling molecules may influence the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we investigated the potential of the basidiomycete Tricholoma vaccinum to produce communication molecules for the interaction with its coniferous host, Norway spruce (Picea abies). We focused on the production of volatile organic compounds and phytohormones in axenic T. vaccinum cultures, identified the potential biosynthesis genes, and investigated their expression by RNA-Seq analyses. T. vaccinum released volatiles not usually associated with fungi, like limonene and -barbatene, and geosmin. Using stable isotope labeling, the biosynthesis of geosmin was elucidated. The geosmin biosynthesis gene ges1 of T. vaccinum was identified, and up-regulation was scored during mycorrhiza, while a different regulation was seen with mycorrhizosphere bacteria. The fungus also released the volatile phytohormone ethylene and excreted salicylic and abscisic acid as well as jasmonates into the medium. The tree excreted the auxin, indole-3-acetic acid, and its biosynthesis intermediate, indole-3-acetamide, as well as salicylic acid with its root exudates. These compounds could be shown for the first time in exudates as well as in soil of a natural ectomycorrhizospheric habitat. The effects of phytohormones present in the mycorrhizosphere on hyphal branching of T. vaccinum were assessed. Salicylic and abscisic acid changed hyphal branching in a concentration-dependent manner.

We show that SlDLK2 expression in roots is AM-dependent and is associated with cells containing arbuscules. SlDLK2 ectopic expression arrests arbuscule branching and downregulates AM-responsive genes, even in the absence of symbiosis; while the opposite effect was observed upon SlDLK2 silencing. Moreover, SlDLK2 overexpression in Medicago truncatula roots showed the same altered phenotype observed in tomato roots.

This study established an in vitro culture system and investigated AR formation in microcuttings of <i>Rhododendron fortunei</i> Lindl. inoculated with <i>Oidiodendron maius</i> Barron Om19, an ericoid mycorrhizal fungus strain. Hormones and precursors involved in the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in Om19 mycelium were analyzed. Om19 was able to produce a large quantity of tryptophan (Trp) and also indole-3-pyruvate (IPA) and IAA, indicating that IAA biosynthesis in Om19 could be through a Trp-dependent pathway. After inoculation of Om19, ARs were quickly formed in microcuttings. Symbiosis related genes were activated in ARs, and Om19 effectively colonized the roots. <i>YUC3</i>, a key gene in plant biosynthesis of IAA and genes involved in nitrogen (N) uptake and metabolism, phosphorus (P) uptake were highly upregulated. Plants absorbed significantly greater quantity of mineral nutrients, and their growth was substantially enhanced compared to the control plants without Om19 inoculation. A working model for Om19 enhanced AR formation was proposed. The rapid formation of ARs in cuttings could be due in part to the induction of IAA biosynthesized by Om19 and also attributed to Trp catalyzed biosynthesis of IAA in plants. AR formation, in turn, provided Om19 preferred sites for colonization. Our study suggested that in addition to promoting AR formation, Om19 could potentially be used as a new biofertilizer for enhancing production of ericaceous plants, such as blueberry, cranberry, and rhododendron.",32922812
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",MtCOPT2 is a Cu<sup>+</sup> transporter specifically expressed in Medicago truncatula mycorrhizal roots.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are critical participants in plant nutrition in natural ecosystems and in sustainable agriculture. A large proportion of the phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfur, and transition metal elements that the host plant requires are obtained from the soil by the fungal mycelium and released at the arbuscules in exchange for photosynthates. While many of the plant transporters responsible for obtaining macronutrients at the periarbuscular space have been characterized, the identities of those mediating transition metal uptake remain unknown. In this work, MtCOPT2 has been identified as the only member of the copper transporter family COPT in the model legume Medicago truncatula to be specifically expressed in mycorrhizal roots. Fusing a C-terminal GFP tag to MtCOPT2 expressed under its own promoter showed a distribution pattern that corresponds with arbuscule distribution in the roots. When expressed in tobacco leaves, MtCOPT2-GFP co-localizes with a plasma membrane marker. MtCOPT2 is intimately related to the rhizobial nodule-specific MtCOPT1, which is suggestive of a shared evolutionary lineage that links transition metal nutrition in the two main root endosymbioses in legumes.",32914374
"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization outcompetes root hairs in maize under low phosphorus availability.,"An increase in root hair length and density and the development of arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis are two alternative strategies of most plants to increase the root-soil surface area under phosphorus (P) deficiency. Across many plant species, root hair length and mycorrhization density are inversely correlated. Root architecture, rooting density and physiology also differ between species. This study aims to understand the relationship among root hairs, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization, plant growth, P acquisition and mycorrhizal-specific Pi transporter gene expression in maize. Using nearly isogenic maize lines, the B73 wild type and the rth3 root hairless mutant, we quantified the effect of root hairs and AMF infection in a calcareous soil under P deficiency through a combined analysis of morphological, physiological and molecular factors. Wild-type root hairs extended the rhizosphere for acid phosphatase activity by 0.5 mm compared with the rth3 hairless mutant, as measured by in situ zymography. Total root length of the wild type was longer than that of rth3 under P deficiency. Higher AMF colonization and mycorrhiza-induced phosphate transporter gene expression were identified in the mutant under P deficiency, but plant growth and P acquisition were similar between mutant and the wild type. The mycorrhizal dependency of maize was 33 % higher than the root hair dependency. The results identified larger mycorrhizal dependency than root hair dependency under P deficiency in maize. Root hairs and AMF inoculation are two alternative ways to increase Pi acquisition under P deficiency, but these two strategies compete with each other.",32877525

Here, we used proteomics and transcriptomics to identify changes in the steady-state levels of proteins and transcripts in the roots of the green terrestrial orchid <i>Oeceoclades maculata</i>. When mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots from the same individuals were compared, 94 proteins showed differential accumulation using the label-free protein quantitation approach, 86 using isobaric tagging and 60 using 2D-differential electrophoresis. After <i>de novo</i> assembly of transcriptomic data, 11,179 plant transcripts were found to be differentially expressed, and 2175 were successfully annotated. The annotated plant transcripts allowed the identification of up- and down-regulated metabolic pathways. Overall, proteomics and transcriptomics revealed, in mycorrhizal roots, increased levels of transcription factors and nutrient transporters, as well as ethylene-related proteins. The expression pattern of proteins and transcripts involved in plant defense responses suggested that plant defense was reduced in <i>O. maculata</i> mycorrhizal roots sampled in nature.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of gibberellins (GAs) on the symbiotic germination of <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> seeds and its functioning in the mutualistic interaction between orchid species and their mycobionts. To do this, we used liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer to quantify endogenous hormones across different development stages between symbiotic and asymbiotic germination of <i>D. officinale</i>, as well as real-time quantitative PCR to investigate gene expression levels during seed germination under the different treatment concentrations of exogenous gibberellic acids (GA<sub>3</sub>). Our results showed that the level of endogenous GA<sub>3</sub> was not significantly different between the asymbiotic and symbiotic germination groups, but the ratio of GA<sub>3</sub> and abscisic acids (ABA) was significantly higher during symbiotic germination than asymbiotic germination. Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> treatment showed that a high concentration of GA<sub>3</sub> could inhibit fungal colonization in the embryo cell and decrease the seed germination rate, but did not significantly affect asymbiotic germination or the growth of the free-living fungal mycelium. The expression of genes involved in the common symbiotic pathway (e.g., calcium-binding protein and calcium-dependent protein kinase) responded to the changed concentrations of exogenous GA<sub>3</sub>.

In fact, orchid seed germination leads to the formation of a protocorm, a heterotrophic postembryonic structure colonized by intracellular fungal coils, thought to be the site of nutrient transfer. The molecular mechanisms underlying mycorrhizal interactions and metabolic changes induced by this symbiosis in both partners remain mostly unknown. We studied plant-fungus interactions in the mycorrhizal association between the Mediterranean orchid Serapias vomeracea and the basidiomycete Tulasnella calospora using nontargeted metabolomics. Plant and fungal metabolomes obtained from symbiotic structures were compared with those obtained under asymbiotic conditions. Symbiosis induced substantial metabolomic alterations in both partners. In particular, structural and signaling lipid compounds increased markedly in the external fungal mycelium growing near the symbiotic protocorms, whereas chito-oligosaccharides were identified uniquely in symbiotic protocorms. This work represents the first description of metabolic changes occurring in orchid mycorrhiza. These results - combined with previous transcriptomic data - provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the orchid mycorrhizal association and open intriguing questions on the role of fungal lipids in this symbiosis.",32668507

Overall, the five studied transgenic lines downregulated for caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) or both COMT and CAD displayed a lower mycorrhizal colonisation percentage, indicating a lower ability for establishing mutualistic interaction than the wild-type. The susceptibility to root-knot nematode infection was variable in the five lines, and the CAD-deficient line was found to be less susceptible than the wild-type. We discuss these phenotypic differences in the light of the large shifts in the metabolic profile and gene expression pattern occurring between roots of the CAD-deficient line and wild-type. A role of genes related to trehalose metabolism, phytohormones, and cell wall construction in the different mycorrhizal symbiosis efficiency and nematode sensitivity between these two lines is suggested. Overall, these results show that the alteration of plant metabolism caused by the repression of a single gene within phenylpropanoid pathway results in significant alterations, at the root level, in the response towards mutualistic and pathogenic associates. These changes may constrain plant fitness and biomass production, which are of economic importance for perennial industrial crops such as poplar.",32647969

"""mycorrhiza"" AND ""gene""",Functional analysis of the OsNPF4.5 nitrate transporter reveals a conserved mycorrhizal pathway of nitrogen acquisition in plants.,"Low availability of nitrogen (N) is often a major limiting factor to crop yield in most nutrient-poor soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are beneficial symbionts of most land plants that enhance plant nutrient uptake, particularly of phosphate. A growing number of reports point to the substantially increased N accumulation in many mycorrhizal plants; however, the contribution of AM symbiosis to plant N nutrition and the mechanisms underlying the AM-mediated N acquisition are still in the early stages of being understood. Here, we report that inoculation with AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> remarkably promoted rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growth and N acquisition, and about 42% of the overall N acquired by rice roots could be delivered via the symbiotic route under N-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply condition. Mycorrhizal colonization strongly induced expression of the putative nitrate transporter gene <i>OsNPF4.5</i> in rice roots, and its orthologs <i>ZmNPF4.5</i> in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>SbNPF4.5</i> in <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> OsNPF4.5 is exclusively expressed in the cells containing arbuscules and displayed a low-affinity NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport activity when expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes.

However, studies on the effect of AMF on viral infection, still limited and not conclusive, indicate that AMF colonization may have a detrimental effect on plant defenses against viruses, so that the term ""mycorrhiza-induced susceptibility"" (MIS) has been proposed for these cases. To expand the case studies to a not yet tested viral family, that is, Bromoviridae, we investigated the effect of the colonization by the AMF <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> on cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) infection in tomato by phenotypic, physiological, biochemical, and transcriptional analyses. Our results showed that the establishment of a functional AM symbiosis is able to limit symptoms development. Physiological and transcriptomic data highlighted that AMF mitigates the drastic downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes and the reduction of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate caused by CMV infection. In parallel, an increase of salicylic acid level and a modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes, toward a limitation of ROS accumulation, was specifically observed in CMV-infected mycorrhizal plants.

The mycorrhizal phosphate uptake pathway (MPU) spans from extraradical hyphae to root cortex cells housing fungal arbuscules and promotes the supply of phosphate to the mycorrhizal host in exchange for photosynthetic carbon. This symbiotic association with the mycobiont has been shown to affect plant host nutritional status and growth performance. However, whether and how the MPU affects the root microbial community associated with mycorrhizal hosts in association with neighboring plants, remains to be demonstrated. Here the maize germinal Mu transposon insertion mutant pht1;6, defective in mycorrhiza-specific Pi transporter PHT1;6 gene, and wild type B73 (wt) plants were grown in mono- and mixed culture and examined under greenhouse and field conditions. Disruption of the MPU in pht1;6 resulted in strongly diminished growth performance, in reduced P allocation to photosynthetic source leaves, and in imbalances in leaf elemental composition beyond P. At the microbial community level a loss of MPU activity had a minor effect on the root-associated fungal microbiome which was almost fully restricted to AM fungi of the Glomeromycotina. Moreover, while wt grew better in presence of pht1;6, pht1;6 accumulated little biomass irrespective of whether it was grown in mono- or mixed culture and despite of an enhanced fungal colonization of its roots in co-culture with wt. This suggested that a functional MPU is prerequisite to maintain maize growth and that neighboring plants competed for AM fungal Pi in low P soil. Thus future strategies towards improving yield in maize populations on soils with low inputs of P fertilizer could be realized by enhancing MPU at the individual plant level while leaving the root-associated fungal community largely unaffected.",32555651

In the present study, there were four different treatments: Funnelliformis mosseae inoculation with or without atrazine; and non-AMF inoculation with or without atrazine. F.mosseae significantly increased atrazine dissipation rate from 28.7% to 53.3%. Then 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated that bacteria community differed significantly by F.mosseae inoculation and atrazine addition. The Shannon index decreased significantly with AMF and atrazine at phylum and family level, and significant inhibition of atrazine on evenness was also observed. LEFSe analysis revealed that Terrimonas and Arthrobacter were significantly associated with F.mosseae, as well as unidentified_Nitrospiraceae associated with atrazine addition. There are several bacterial taxa associated with both F.mosseae inoculation and atrazine addition. Totally, twelve atrazine-degrading bacterial genera (>0.10%) were identified. When atrazine was added, the abundance of Arthrobacter, Burkholderia, Mycobacterium and Streptomyces increased in F.mosseae inoculation treatment, but Nocardioides, Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Rhodobacter, Methylobacterium, Bosea and Shinella decreased. In the presence of atrazine, activities of dehydrogenase, urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase in F.mosseae inoculation treatment were significantly higher than those in non-inoculation.

In addition, orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) that establish a symbiotic relationship with an orchid host can later proliferate in browning and rotting orchid tissues. Environmental triggers and molecular mechanisms governing the switch leading to either a saprotrophic or a mycorrhizal behavior in OMF remain unclear. As the sequenced OMF genomes feature a wide range of genes putatively involved in the degradation of plant cell wall (PCW) components, we tested if these transitions may be correlated with a change in the expression of some PCW degrading enzymes. Regulation of several genes encoding PCW degrading enzymes was evaluated during saprotrophic growth of the OMF <i>Tulasnella calospora</i> on different substrates and under successful and unsuccessful mycorrhizal symbioses.

Expression profiles were detected by RT-PCR at six plant stages of development (second leaf, third leaf, shooting, axillary shoot branching initiation, axillary shoot branching, flowering initiation). In comparison to control (without AM), the variant with AM inoculation exhibited a significant elevation of transcription levels of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes (MlSUS, MlHXK1) and sucrose transporters (MlSUC4) in <i>M. lupulina</i> leaves at the shooting stage. We suggest that this leads to a significant increase in the frequency of AM infection, an abundance of mycelium in roots and an increase in AM efficiency (which is calculated by the fresh weight of aerial parts and roots at the axillary shoot branching initiation stage). In roots, the specificity of <i>MlPT4</i> and <i>MlATP1</i> gene expressions were revealed for effective AM symbiosis. The level of <i>MlPT4</i> transcripts in AM roots increased more than tenfold in comparison to that of non-specific <i>MlPT1</i> and <i>MlPT2</i>. For the first time, <i>MlPT1</i> expression was shown to increase sharply against <i>MlPT2</i> in <i>M. lupulina</i> roots without AM at the shooting initiation stage.

Chickpea roots establish symbiotic relationships with soil microorganisms, resulting in the formation of root nodules essential for biological nitrogen fixation. In this study, 20 chickpea genotypes were selected from a genome-wide association panel to assess nodulation traits under eight different treatment combinations involving biofertilizers (<i>Rhizobium</i>, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza - VAM) and inorganic fertilizers (NPK) using a randomized block design with three replications. Pre-planting soil preparation included the application of fertilizers and biofertilizers. Comprehensive analyses including descriptive statistics, correlation, path analysis, principal component analysis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and gene expression studies were conducted. Among treatments, the NPK+<i>Rhizobium</i> combination significantly enhanced nodulation across genotypes, while the <i>Rhizobium</i>+VAM (T7) treatment identified ICC-9085 as a superior donor for the number of nodules, aiming for sustainable chickpea productivity.

The marked upregulation of CaNFP underlines its potential as a target for enhancing symbiotic efficiency. The availability of the chickpea draft genome opens new avenues for employing genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas systems. Targeted editing of the CaNFP gene offers a promising strategy to improve nodule formation, nitrogen fixation, and overall plant vigor.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of foliar application of the synthetic peptides ENOD40 and CEP1 on common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) under both greenhouse and field conditions. Using a factorial design, we examined gene expression patterns, nodulation parameters, and yield-related traits in response to peptide treatments alone or in combination with <i>Rhizobium</i>.

While rolB/rolC genes from Rhizobium rhizogenes activate plant secondary metabolism, their constitutive expression causes adverse morphological alterations. To overcome this, we engineered A. belladonna with root-specific rolB/rolC expression driven by the hyoscyamine 6--hydroxylase (H6H) promoter. Transgenic (pH6H::rolB/pH6H::rolC) maintained control plants aerial morphology but developed enhanced root systems, with pH6H::rolB occasionally yielding double flowers. Metabolite analysis revealed unprecedented hyoscyamine accumulation: 24.43-fold (pH6H::rolB) and 39.31-fold (pH6H::rolC) increases in leaves, the latter achieving a record 7475gg<sup>-1</sup> DW. Transcriptional profiling showed rolC upregulated more mTAs biosynthetic genes (11 vs rolB's 10). RNA-seq analysis revealed that rolC exerts a stronger global influence compared to rolB (3811 vs. 2496 upregulated genes). Furthermore, the study identified MATE (EVM0020509, 17.6-fold), PUP (EVM0030490, 3.49-fold), and ABC transporters as potential mediators of root-to-leaf mTAs translocation. Both lines exhibited enhanced drought tolerance via elevated antioxidant activities (SOD/POD/CAT), increased proline, and reduced MDA under stress. These findings establish rolC as the dominant mTAs biosynthetic driver.

We show that the artificial target mimic <i>MIM169defg</i> can indeed complement the reduced capability of nodule formation in <i>enod40-1-2/1</i>, and that box2 exhibits target mimic activity in a transient luciferase assay. In addition, the introduction of a <i>miR169</i>-resistant form of <i>MtNF-YA1</i> also elevates the capacity to form nodules in <i>enod40-1-2/1.</i> We conclude that <i>ENOD40</i> effectuates nodule initiation by posttranscriptional upregulation of the <i>miR169</i> target <i>NF-YA1</i>, which encodes an essential transcription factor in this step of the nodulation process.",40844763
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",The sTDIF signaling peptide modulates the root stele diameter and primary metabolism to accommodate symbiotic nodulation.,"Legume plants form specific organs on their root system, the nitrogen-fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic interaction with soil bacteria collectively named rhizobia. Rhizobia, however, do not only induce the formation of these nodule organs but also modulate root system architecture. We identified in Medicago truncatula a previously unnoticed increase in the root stele diameter occurring upon rhizobium inoculation. This symbiotic root response, similarly observed in another crop legume, pea, occurs rapidly and locally after rhizobium inoculation, leading to an increased number of vascular cells. Interestingly, this root stele diameter symbiotic response requires tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor (TDIF) signaling peptides and, notably, the MtCLE37 TDIF-encoding gene whose expression is increased during nodulation, thus being referred to as symbiotic nodulation TDIF (sTDIF). Indeed, a cle37/stdif mutant is not responsive to rhizobium regarding its root stele diameter increase and has a reduced nodule number. Combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that stdif has a defective primary metabolism, notably affecting carbohydrate/sugar accumulation in both roots and nodules. Remarkably, a sucrose or a malate exogenous treatment is able to rescue the rhizobium-induced stele diameter symbiotic response in stdif. This metabolic deregulation is thus instrumental in explaining the altered symbiotic response of the mutant. Overall, this study highlights a novel function of TDIF signaling peptides in legumes plants, which, beyond regulating stele development, also modulates the root primary metabolism adaptations required for symbiotic nodule development.",40834857

The effects of the physical and chemical properties of soil on community composition were analyzed. The results revealed that (1) the soil water content, falkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content, and total nitrogen content in the slight rocky desertification (SRD) area GJ4 were significantly greater than those in the moderate rocky desertification (MRD) areas KY2 and MZ3. (2) The composition of the endophytic bacterial community significantly differed among the four groups (R<sup>2</sup>=0.389, P=0.036). The abundance and diversity of endophytic bacteria in the SRD area were significantly greater than those in the MRD area. In areas of MRD, Pseudomonas was the most abundant genus. The dominant genus in the SRD area was Rhizobium. (3) In Gejiu, Yunnan Province, we observed that higher degrees of rocky desertification were associated with lower soil water content. Additionally, the diversity of endophytic bacteria decreased with increasing rocky desertification. The degree of rocky desertification, total nitrogen content, total phosphorus content, and soil pH are the main factors shaping the community composition of endophytic bacteria in the nodules of V. villosa.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase AeRLCK2 mediates Nod-independent rhizobial symbiosis in Aeschynomene legumes.,"Many plants interact symbiotically with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to enhance inorganic phosphorus uptake, and legumes also develop a nodule symbiosis with rhizobia for nitrogen acquisition. The establishment and functioning of both symbioses rely on a common plant signaling pathway activated by structurally related Myc and Nod factors. Recently, a SPARK receptor-like kinase (RLK)/receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) complex was shown to be essential for arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in both monocot and dicot plants. Here, we show that in Aeschynomene legumes, the RLCK component of this receptor complex has undergone a gene duplication event and mediates a unique nodule symbiosis that is independent of rhizobial Nod factors. In Aeschynomene evenia, AeRLCK2 is crucial for nodule initiation but not for arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. Additionally, AeRLCK2 physically interacts with and is phosphorylated by the cysteine-rich RLK, AeCRK, which is also required for nodulation.

Sucrose, the principal product of photosynthesis, is critical in supporting this process. Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying sucrose allocation following rhizobia inoculation remain poorly understood. Here, we identified and characterized GmSWEET3c, a rhizobia-induced sucrose transporter that is critical for sucrose allocation to the root susceptible zone. Functional analysis of the Gmsweet3c mutant revealed impaired sucrose allocation and a significant reduction in nodule formation, underscoring its critical role in symbiotic nodulation. Using a GmSWEET3c-GFP fusion protein, we found that the protein is located in both the plasma membrane of root cells and the membranes of infection threads, suggesting dual roles of GmSWEET3c in facilitating sucrose transport to the root susceptible zone and directing sucrose toward infection threads. Moreover, we demonstrated that GmNSP1, a key symbiotic transcription factor, directly binds to the promoter region of GmSWEET3c, activating its expression. Collectively, our findings highlight GmSWEET3c as a key mediator of sucrose distribution in soybean roots after rhizobia inoculation, enhancing our understanding of carbohydrate allocation in legume-rhizobia symbioses.",40763740

The outcome of these interactions for plant hosts varies quantitatively and can range from highly beneficial to even detrimental depending on natural genetic variation in microbial symbionts. Here, we take a systems genetics approach, harnessing the genetic diversity present in wild rhizobial populations to predict genes and molecular pathways crucial in determining partner quality, i.e., the benefits of symbiosis for legume hosts. We combine traits, dual-RNAseq of both partners from active nodules, pangenomics/pantranscriptomics, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for a panel of 20 <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> strains that vary in symbiotic partner quality. We find that genetic variation in the nodule transcriptome predicts host plant biomass, and WGCNA reveals networks of genes in plants and rhizobia that are coexpressed and associated with high-quality symbiosis. Presence-absence variation of gene clusters on the symbiosis plasmid (pSymA), validated in planta, is associated with high or low-quality symbiosis and is found within important coexpression modules.

Developing this symbiotic capability in cereal crops like rice is a promising strategy to reduce dependency on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, but it is neither simple nor easy. To find whether legume-specific Nod Factor receptor genes are expressed in rice and whether they can change root hair morphology. We developed transgenic rice plants harbouring two NF receptor genes, a co-receptor gene and two NF binding proteins: MtLYK3, MtNFP, MtDMI2, LjLNP, and MtSYMREM1. When transgenic rice roots were inoculated with fluorescent Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti), colonization of bacteria was observed on the root surface. Still, it was reduced significantly in the presence of nitrogen in the media. Gene expression of all the five transgenes in the S.meliloti inoculated roots increased to 3.5 fold. Root hair deformation was also observed when transgenic rice roots were treated with purified SmNod Factor (SmNF), and the presence of nitrogen in the medium reduced the root hair deformation percentage. This study suggested that rice could interact with S. meliloti for colonization and gene expression and also could perceive the NF signal to deform root hair when the legume-specific NF receptor genes along with co-receptor gene and two NF binding proteins were present in the rice plant. This is an initial indication that rice roots can behave like a symbiotic legume if appropriate genes are transferred to it.",40694187

Research has uncovered many of the genes required for the symbiosis; however, engineering the symbiosis to function with alternative hosts such as cereal crops necessitates the establishment of a core set of symbiotic players. We examined the symbiotic relevance of the genes on the 1.68Mb pSymB chromid of the model rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti. By employing a strain in which pSymB was removed, we used a gain-of-function approach to assess a select group of known symbiotic regions totalling 261kb (15.5%) of pSymB. This gene set enabled symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation with alfalfa with a high degree of plant genotype-dependent variation in which nodules often senesced prematurely. We demonstrate that additional regions lacking canonical symbiosis genes are important for the efficient formation of symbiosis with the plant host.

The parasitism by root-feeding nematodes is on the negative end of the interaction spectrum, and may be very difficult to control. Biological agents are a promising alternative to the environmentally harmful nematicides; however, their efficiency in natural soil often seems to be low due to their limited establishment and dispersal. Thus, understanding how the introduced biological agents interact with nematodes and the surrounding microbiota is necessary to improve sustainable management of root-feeding nematodes. Here, we conducted two experiments to study the effects of Pseudomonas protegens strain CHA0 (CHA0) on the performance of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. In the first experiment, we compared M. incognita performance in natural and sterilized soil in the presence and absence of CHA0. In the second experiment, we studied the composition of microbes in the rhizosphere and endosphere of tomato plants grown in native soil in response to M. incognita and CHA0. We found that nematode performance, especially nematode reproduction, was significantly increased in native soil amended with CHA0. In addition, we found the highest relative abundance of Pseudomonas in tomato endosphere in response to nematode co-inoculations with CHA0, which suggests that root wounding, caused by nematodes, increased the entrance of inoculated and/or native Pseudomonas spp. As many Pseudomonas spp. are plant growth promoting, this may explain that plant growth was highest in this treatment. Furthermore, the rhizosphere of nematode-inoculated plants was enriched with Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga and Variovorax, which are genera generally associated with nematode-suppressive soils. On the other hand, other known nematode-suppressive genera such as Bacillus, Lysobacter, Devosia and Rhizobium were depleted in plants where nematodes were co-inoculated with CHA0, which may explain the higher nematode performance when plants were co-inoculated with CHA0. Our findings show that the effect of P. protegens strain CHA0 on M. incognita parasitism is influenced by the multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere and endosphere of tomato plants. We must understand these interactions thoroughly to optimize sustainable means to mitigate the root-knot nematodes.",40597288

Taken together, our data suggest that 4HBA is a substrate for PecM.IMPORTANCEPlant roots secrete a number of compounds that may be toxic to bacteria residing in the surrounding soil. One such bacterium is <i>Agrobacterium fabrum</i>, which infects plants and induces tumor formation. We show here that an <i>A. fabrum</i> strain in which the efflux pump PecM has been disrupted accumulates 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and that this plant root exudate induces the expression of <i>pecM</i>. Our data suggest that PecM and PecS, a transcription factor that regulates <i>pecM</i> expression, both function to promote <i>A. fabrum</i> fitness in the rhizosphere. As a competitive advantage in the rhizosphere is a prerequisite for subsequent plant infection, our data contribute to a more complete understanding of the <i>A. fabrum</i> infection process.",40511934
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",An isoflavone reductase-like protein MtIFL negatively regulates nodule symbiosis in Medicago truncatula.,"Flavonoids are valuable metabolites produced by legumes, including Medicago truncatula, and play crucial roles in signaling communication during legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Isoflavone reductase proteins (IFRs) are involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavones and plant defense regulation. However, their role in symbiotic nitrogen fixation remains mostly elusive. Here, 13 putative IFR gene family members were identified, and an IFR-like gene named MtIFL was functionally characterized through expression patterns, phenotypic characterizations, flavonoid metabolome, and transcriptome analyses. Furthermore, the binding partner of MtIFL was investigated using Y1H, EMSA, and Dual-LUC assays. MtIFL was strongly induced in the process of nodule development and expressed in the meristem and infection zone of mature nodules. Knockout of MtIFL promoted nodulation, while overexpression of MtIFL induced premature senescence of nodules. Further investigations revealed that MtIFL negatively regulates nitrogen-fixing symbiosis by mediating isoflavone metabolism, and MtNIN regulates MtIFL expression by binding to the hNRE motif. Overall, our findings suggest that MtIFL negatively regulates nodule formation, thereby influencing the survival of rhizobia in nodule cells. MtNIN regulates MtIFL expression and may play a role in isoflavone metabolism. These results provide novel insights into the function of IFRs in symbiotic nodulation and the role of flavonoids in nodule development.",40433813
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Overexpression of Rhizobium rhizogenes A4-rolB enhances osmotic stress resistance in Arabidopsis.,"Functional investigation of individual Rhizobium rhizogenes oncogene contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying R. rhizogenes-plant transformation, which holds the potential of enhancing plants' abiotic stress resistance. The root oncogenic locus (rol) B gene, a key oncogene of R. rhizogenes, was reported to participate in abiotic stress resistance in transformed plants. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. This study investigated Arabidopsis overexpressing A4-rolB (rolB-OX) for phenotypic modifications and short-term osmotic stress resistance. Data showed that A4-rolB induced pronounced dwarfing phenotypes and weakened root growth in rolB-OX as shown by its compact growth and significantly decreased root length and root surface area (59% and 63% of wild type Col-0, respectively) under normal growth conditions. Under polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) 10% (w/v)-induced osmotic stress, rolB-OX exhibited enhanced resistance to osmotic stress compared with Col-0, as exemplified by less severe leaf wilting, increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and a better recovery of stomatal conductance after PEG treatment. Moreover, A4-rolB mediated enhancement in abscisic acid (ABA) levels under well-watered conditions, which may have facilitated stress resistance of rolB-OX under PEG exposure, probably through inducing TAC. Furthermore, after PEG stress, rolB-OX exhibited dramatically up-regulated (3.3-5.7-fold of Col-0) transcript levels of genes encoding plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) (i.e., PIP2;5 and PIP2;7), which are correlated with an improved plant hydraulic conductivity. This study reports an enhanced osmotic stress resistance in rolB-OX, which could be attributed to A4-rolB-mediated increase in leaf ABA levels and TAC and improved stomatal regulation. Furthermore, the association between ABA and TAC, and its effect on the osmotic stress resistance caused by rolB, was thoroughly discussed in this study. These findings reveal novel physiological effects of A4-rolB on plant abiotic stress resistance.",40426079

At thirty days after inoculation (DAI), a significant increase in SPAD values was observed, and the expression of GL synthesis marker genes was also significantly increased. At 150 DAI, a significant increase in biomass was observed. Characteristically, it was also found that thick roots were enlarged by rhizobial inoculation. In addition, the expression of GL synthesis marker genes was also significantly increased. Moreover, GL content per unit root dry weight reached 4%, and GL production per plant increased six times compared to uninoculated plants. Moreover, we tried to reveal the mechanism of induction of GL production by rhizobial inoculation. Since it has been reported that the expression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis marker genes is increased by rhizobium in soybean, we investigated the expression of those genes in G. glabra, and found that GgMYC2 and GgJAR1 were up-regulated at Thirty DAI. Furthermore, methyl jasmonate treatment increased the expression of GL synthesis marker genes, suggesting that JA signaling is involved in the increased GL production due to rhizobial inoculation. These results aid in understanding the mechanism of increased GL production through the introduction of rhizobial symbiosis, and show the potential for providing a technology to significantly shorten the cultivation period for the production of Glycyrrhiza that meets the criteria for herbal medicines.",40415147

However, the precise mechanisms by how the scion cultivar contributes to the recruitment and assembly of rhizosphere bacteria remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the root transcriptome and metabolomics coupled with the amplification of the rhizosphere bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that scion cultivars with different net photosynthesis rates significantly impacted root metabolites and the expression of root sugar metabolism genes. Moreover, rhizosphere-specific taxa (Rhizobium, Nitrospira and Ensifer) are associated with root sugar metabolites, particularly sucrose. The foliar application of 2% sucrose on leaves enhanced root sugar metabolism and shaped the rhizosphere microbiota, notably promoting the growth and colonization of the bacterial isolation in the rhizosphere of apple plantlets.

There is considerable interest in structurally and functionally characterizing novel DNA ligases and profiling their suitability for molecular-biological applications. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase from the Rhizobium phage vB_RleM_P10VF bound to a nicked DNA duplex determined to 2.2 resolution. The enzyme crystallized in the DNA-encircling conformation, arrested as a step 2 intermediate in the catalytic cycle with the adenylating cofactor transferred to the 5'-phosphate of the DNA nick. The overall structure of the DNA ligase closely resembles that of the T4 DNA ligase, including an -helical globular DNA-binding domain.

With bibliometrics, this study employed CiteSpace and VOSvivewer softwares to analyze the publications on hairy roots researches from 2009 to 2024 based on WOS database. The subject distribution, countries, institutions and personnel, research hotspots and research trends of hairy roots were discussed and analyzed. The results revealed a consistent increase in publications on hairy root with America, China and India as the main countries. The institutions were mainly universities and the Chinese Academy of Sciences was a major contributor to this topic and had close cooperation with other institutions.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Accumulation of numerous cellular T-DNA sequences in the genus Diospyros by multiple rounds of natural transformation.,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important phenomenon in the evolutionary history of plants. Natural transformation by Agrobacterium is a special case of HGT and leads to the insertion of cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA) sequences, for example, in Diospyros lotus. The genus Diospyros contains about 795 species with economically important members, like different types of persimmon (D. kaki, D. lotus, and D. virginiana) and ebony (e.g., D. ebenum). Whole genome sequences (WGS) from D. kaki, D. oleifera, D. lotus, and D. virginiana were investigated for cT-DNAs. These four species belong to one clade and contain 15 different cT-DNAs (DiTA to DiTO). The hexaploid species D. kaki cv. ""Xiaoguo-tianshi"" contains seven types of cT-DNA (DiTA to DiTG) on 27 of 42 homeologs, adding up to 628kb of cT-DNA. Five of these seven cT-DNAs are non-fixed, as shown by empty chromosomal insertion sites. The evolutionary history of the Diospyros cT-DNAs was reconstructed using the divergence of their inverted repeats. Insert age varied from 3 to 12 million years. Partial cT-DNA sequences were detected in 35 additional species from five Diospyros clades. Our data highlight the unexpectedly large scale of natural Agrobacterium transformation in Diospyros and demonstrate the necessity of whole genome approaches for studies on the origin and evolution of cT-DNAs.",40359552

However, the genetic interplay between soybean cultivars and the rhizobial species colonizing their roots under natural conditions is yet to be sufficiently assessed. In this study, we build on previous observations that have revealed a significant variation in the prevalence of rhizobial species associated with the soybean cultivars ""Peking"" and ""Tamahomare."" Using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Peking and Tamahomare, we performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the proportion of <i>Rhizobium</i> species present in the root nodules of these cultivars and accordingly identified a major QTL on chromosome 18, accounting for 42% of the phenotypic variation, which was subsequently localized to a 240-kb region. RNA-seq analysis indicated that a single gene harboring nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat domains exhibited markedly different expression within the QTL region in the parent cultivars. As this locus is distinct from the chromosomal regions containing known nodule-related genes, such as <i>Rj</i> and <i>rj</i>, we speculate that it represents a novel gene involved in the symbiosis between rhizobia and soybeans. Further research on the function and role of this new gene could potentially contribute to enhancing soybean yield, and hence sustainable agriculture, under low-nitrogen fertilization conditions.",40330701

A microbial consortium comprising <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. PKS, <i>Bacillus</i> sp. PU-7, and <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> AMF was employed. Microbial identification was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biochemical evaluations of consortium-inoculated plants included measurements of protein, sugar, proline, and chlorophyll levels, along with IAA quantification. A consortium of <i>Bacillus</i> sp.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",The non-specific phospholipase C of common bean PvNPC4 modulates roots and nodule development.,"Plant phospholipase C (PLC) proteins are phospholipid-degrading enzymes classified into two subfamilies: phosphoinositide-specific PLCs (PI-PLCs) and non-specific PLCs (NPCs). PI-PLCs have been widely studied in various biological contexts, including responses to abiotic and biotic stresses and plant development; NPCs have been less thoroughly studied. No PLC subfamily has been characterized in relation to the symbiotic interaction between Fabaceae (legume) species and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. However, lipids are reported to be crucial to this interaction, and PLCs may therefore contribute to regulating legume-rhizobia symbiosis. In this work, we functionally characterized NPC4 from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) during rhizobial symbiosis, findings evidence that NPC4 plays an important role in bean root development. The knockdown of PvNPC4 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in fewer and shorter primary roots and fewer lateral roots than were seen in control plants. Importantly, this phenotype seems to be related to altered auxin signaling. In the bean-rhizobia symbiosis, PvNPC4 transcript abundance increased 3 days after inoculation with Rhizobium tropici. Moreover, the number of infection threads and nodules, as well as the transcript abundance of PvEnod40, a regulatory gene of early stages of symbiosis, decreased in PvNPC4-RNAi roots. Additionally, transcript abundance of genes involved in autoregulation of nodulation (AON) was altered by PvNPC4 silencing. These results indicate that PvNPC4 is a key regulator of root and nodule development, underscoring the participation of PLC in rhizobial symbiosis.",40323933
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Plant glutamyl-tRNA reductases coordinate plant and rhizobial heme biosynthesis in nitrogen-fixing nodules.,"Heme is biosynthesized in legume root nodules to meet the demand for leghemoglobins (Lbs) and other heme-binding proteins. However, the main source of nodule heme remains unknown. Both the plant host and rhizobia possess a complete heme biosynthetic pathway, differing slightly in the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a key regulatory step catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) in the plant and by HemA in the rhizobia. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many plant heme biosynthetic genes, including GluTR2 but not GluTR1, are upregulated in nodules compared to roots, whereas expression of related rhizobial genes, including both HemA1 and HemA2, is generally inhibited under symbiotic conditions compared to free-living conditions. Knockout of Lotus japonicus GluTR2, but not of HemA1 and HemA2, led to a significant decrease (50%) in nodule heme content. The stable heterozygous mutant of GluTR1 or transient knockdown of GluTR1 exhibited a 20% reduction in nodule heme content. Overexpression of Fluorescent in blue light (FLU), a feedback inhibitor of GluTR activity, caused a much greater reduction in nodule heme content (75%) and an increased level of apo-Lb and, in combination with the hemA1 hemA2 mutant, a drastic inhibition of nitrogenase activity (>90%). This study provides genetic evidence supporting a major role of plant GluTRs in coordinating heme biosynthesis between the two symbionts by supplying heme to assemble with cytoplasmic apo-Lbs and by providing ALA for heme synthesis in the bacteroids.",40315358
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Expression profiling and transcriptional regulation of the SRS transcription factor gene family of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in symbiosis with Rhizobium etli.,"The SRS/STY transcription factors from the model legumes: Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, are part of regulatory networks that play relevant roles for nodule development during the N-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. In this work we analyzed the participation of the PvSRS transcription factors from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), a most important legume crop, in the symbiosis with Rhizobium etli. Our phylogenetic analysis of SRS TFs across five plant species, including four legumes and Arabidopsis thaliana, identified clades that group SRS proteins that are highly expressed in legume nodules and in Arabidopsis roots. A qRT-PCR expression analysis of the 10 PvSRS in root/nodule of inoculated plants, revealed that all the PvSRS genes are expressed at different stages of the symbiosis, albeit at different levels. Based on what is known for L. japonicus, we demonstrated that the PvSRS10 gene -with highest expression during symbiosis- is transcriptionally activated by NF-Y transcription factor, thus indicating its participation in the NIN-NF-Y regulatory cascade. Based on our previous work about the relevant role of members from the MADS-domain/AGL transcription factors as regulators of the N-fixing symbiosis, in this work we demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of PvSRS10 by the MADS-TF PvFUL-like. Analysis of protein-protein interaction networks predicted thatPvSRS5 and PvSRS6 interact with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and the auxin-activated signaling pathway. The regulatory mechanisms of PvSRS TF in common bean symbiosis may be related to auxin biosynthesis regulation, that is essential for determinate nodules development. Our study highlights the role of PvSRS TF in the N-/fixing symbiosis, a relevant process for sustainable agriculture.",40315204

In this study, we investigated the community diversity and potential plant growth-promoting abilities of endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in different tissues of apple trees by combining high-throughput sequencing of the <i>nifH</i> gene with traditional isolation and cultivation techniques. Sequencing results revealed that the endophytic bacteria were affiliated with 10 phyla, 14 classes, 30 orders, 42 families, and 72 genera. <i>Rhizobium</i> was the dominant genus in the roots and twigs, while <i>Desulfovibrio</i> dominated the leaf tissues. The diversity and richness of endophytic bacteria in the roots were significantly higher than those in the leaves. Using four types of nitrogen-free media, a total of 138 presumptive endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacterial strains were isolated from roots, leaves, and twigs. These isolates belonged to 32 taxonomic groups spanning 5 phyla, 8 classes, 11 orders, 13 families, and 18 genera. The <i>nifH</i> gene was successfully amplified from the representative strains of all 32 groups using specific primers. Nitrogenase activity among the isolates ranged from 26.86 to 982.28 nmol/(hmL). Some strains also exhibited the ability to secrete indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphate and potassium, and produce siderophores. Six individual strains and three microbial consortia were tested for their plant growth-promoting effects on apple tissue culture seedlings. All treatments showed growth-promoting effects to varying degrees, with the RD01+RC16 consortium showing the most significant results: plant height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll content were 2.4, 3.3, and 4.2 times higher than those of the control, respectively.

Hairy roots were induced using two <i>R. rhizogenes</i> strains, A4 and ATCC 15834; transformation was confirmed by PCR analysis targeting the rol and aux genes. The A4 strain exhibited higher transformation efficiency (41.3%) than ATCC 15834 (30.2%). Eight transgenic root clones (C1-C8) were established and confirmed as transformed. The clones exhibited significant variation in biomass accumulation and phenolic acid production. RA production was most strongly correlated with <i>PAL</i>, <i>RAS</i>, and <i>CYP98A14</i> expression. Hierarchical clustering clustered the clones into three groups based on growth, metabolite content, and gene expression.

Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains.

Inoculation with AM fungi can promote nodulation and N<sub>2</sub> fixation of legume plants; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, root exudates collected from AM-colonised soybean plants showed greater accumulation of the specific flavonoids (daidzein and genistein) and phenolic acids (benzoic acid and p-Hydroxybenzoic acid), and significantly promoted nodulation. Furthermore, the exudates from AM-colonised roots and the derived specific flavonoids and phenolic acids effectively increased rhizobial growth, chemotaxis, biofilm formation. Addition of the specific synthetic root exudates enhanced nodulation and N<sub>2</sub> fixation, and expression of the core nodulation genes in soybean. Overexpression of a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene, GmPAL2.4 markedly upregulated the expression of the genes related to the biosynthesis of daidzein, genistein, benzoic acid, and p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, and increased accumulation of these specific flavonoids and phenolic acids in the transgenic plants, thus enhancing nodulation and N<sub>2</sub> fixation.

Rhizobia are rod-shaped, Gram-negative alpha-proteobacteria capable of establishing a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with compatible legume hosts. These bacteria can live freely in the soil or as intracellular symbionts within root nodules. Here, we characterized an orphan OmpR-type response regulator in Rhizobium etli CE3, which we renamed CenR due to its similarity to CenR proteins known as essential regulators of cell envelope-related functions in alpha-proteobacteria. We identified the cognate histidine kinase encoded by cenK, located in a separate genomic region from cenR. CenR and CenK form a TCS that has not been previously reported in Rhizobium. Our results indicate that the overexpression of cenR as well as the absence of cenK, negatively impacts R. etli growth and cell morphology, while bacteria overexpressing cenR also exhibit uncoordinated cell division. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CenKR TCS directly or indirectly regulates the expression of essential genes involved in pathways that control cell growth and morphology. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that CenR binds directly to the promoter regions of two uncharacterized genes in R. etli. Furthermore, analysis of the R. etli - common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) symbiosis revealed increased infection threads, reduced leghemoglobin content, and lower nitrogen fixation efficiency in nodules infected by the cenR-overexpressing strain.

Here, we studied how the auxin gradient is associated with the spatiotemporal expression patterns of known auxin biosynthesis and transport genes at different stages of nodule development in Medicago (Medicago truncatula). In addition, we examined the Medicago PIN-FORMED10 (MtPIN10) expression pattern and polar positioning on the cell membrane during nodule primordium development to investigate auxin flux.

Applicable to all legumes, nodulation is induced by Rhizobium/Bradyrhizobium-produced lipopolysaccharides (Nod factors), perceived by Nod factor receptors (NFR1/NFR5 dimers), leading to cortical and pericycle cell divisions. These induce the production of CLAVATA3-like (CLE) peptides, which travel in the xylem to the shoot, where they are perceived by a receptor complex including a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase, encoded by GmNARK, LjHAR1, MtSUNN and closely related receptors in other legumes like Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean), Pisum sativum (pea), and Glycine soja. The activated receptor complex negatively regulates by phosphorylation of the constitutive synthesis of miR2111 in the shoot.

Nodulation is therefore permitted during a developmental window between the induction and progress of the nodulation/cell division/infection cascade during the first few days after inoculation and the functional ""readiness"" of the AON cascade, delayed by the root-shoot-root loop. Loss-of-function mutations in GmNARK and LjTML result in excessive nodulation (supernodulation/hypernodulation/supernummary nodulation) as well as localized tolerance to externally applied nitrate. Recent analyses have indicated an interaction of the AON with lateral root formation as well as with the autoregulation of mycorrhization (AOM). Further details of the parallel functions of key points in this regulatory loop remain to be elucidated.",40125797
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Effects of N and P Fertilization on Soil N-Cycling Microbial Community Structure in White Clover Grasslands.,"Although nitrifying and N-fixing functional gene microbes play a crucial role in regulating ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling, understanding of how N and phosphorus (P) fertilization affect their community structure remains limited. N fertilizer levels were set to simulate N deposition and combined with different P fertilizer levels, to explore the soil-root-shoot physiological indexes, and the response of community structure of N-fixing and nitrifying microorganisms that caused changes in the N cycle of the system to fertilization. The results showed that N and P fertilization significantly decreased soil N pool (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, IN), the concentrations of shoot TN, root TP, root OC, and root biomass, and slowed down soil N flux (net ammoniation rate, net nitrification rate, and net N mineralization rate). This effect was more pronounced under NP fertilization compared to single N or P fertilization. Short-term N and P fertilization had little effect on AOA and AOB. Anaeromyxobacter is a dominant genus of diazotrophs, and its relative abundance was significantly improved by N fertilization. Fertilization significantly increased Geobacter, but significantly decreased the relative abundance of Zoogloea, Rhizobium, and Azohydromonas. Root biomass and TP, soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, OC, and AP changed by fertilization were the main factors affecting N-fixing microorganisms. This study showed that in addition to soil N, soil OC and P changes caused by fertilization were also important factors affecting the N-cycling microbial community structure.

This perennial herbaceous plant also serves as a model for studying the Rosaceae family. Despite the complex polyploidy of strawberries, extensive efforts in traditional breeding over the years have resulted in improvements in yield, fruit size and shape, berry quality, and various other aspects of strawberry production. However, in addition to these conventional methods, advanced genetic technologies such as genetic modification and gene editing in intricate polyploidy varieties of strawberry are also required. Here, we present the <i>Rhizobium rhizogenes</i>-mediated hairy-root transformation of daughter plants from the model strawberry <i>Fragaria vesca</i>'s stolons (also called runners), which exhibit diploid genomes. As a case study, new daughter plants were cut from the stolons, infected with <i>R. rhizogenes</i> harboring the <i>mVENUS</i> gene under Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and then transferred on vermiculite-filled pots. After a couple of months of growth, fluorescence was observed in a few adventurous roots of the daughter plants. The hairy root transformation of daughter plants isolated from its vegetative propagation circumvents the need for seed production or callus formation and subsequent plant regeneration, which are often problematic for maintaining preferred genetic traits in complex ploidy levels. This method, which excludes genetic modification of the above-ground parts, especially the edible fruits, will open new avenues for strawberry breeding, particularly in the areas of plant nutrient absorption and fostering growth through interactions with microorganisms.",40083581
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Promising protective treatment potential of endophytic bacterium <i>Rhizobium aegyptiacum</i> for ulcerative colitis in rats.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition of the intestine, resulting from an increase in oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators. In this study, the extract of endophytic bacterium <i>Rhizobium aegyptiacum</i> was prepared for the first time using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In addition, also for the first time, the protective potential of <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> was revealed using an in vivo rat model of UC. The animals were grouped into four categories: normal control (group I), <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> (group II), acetic acid (AA)-induced UC (group III), and <i>R. aegyptiacum</i>-treated AA-induced UC (group IV). In group IV, <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> was administered at 0.2 mg/kg daily for one week before and two weeks after the induction of UC. After sacrificing the rats on the last day of the experiment, colon tissues were collected and subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical investigations. There was a remarkable improvement in the histological findings of the colon tissues in group IV, as revealed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Normal mucosal surfaces covered with a straight, intact, and thin brush border were revealed. Goblet cells appeared magenta in color, and there was a significant decrease in the distribution of collagen fibers in the mucosa and submucosal connective tissues. All these findings were comparable to the respective characteristics of the control group. Regarding cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) immunostaining, a weak immune reaction was shown in most cells. Moreover, the colon tissues were examined using a scanning electron microscope, which confirmed the results of histological assessment. A regular polygonal unit pattern was seen with crypt orifices of different sizes and numerous goblet cells. Furthermore, the levels of catalase (CAT), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interlukin-1 (IL-1) were determined in the colonic tissues of the different groups using colorimetric assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In comparison with group III, group IV exhibited a significant rise (<i>P</i><0.05) in the CAT level but a substantial decline (<i>P</i><0.05) in the NO, MPO, and inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and IL-1) levels. Based on reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the tumor necrosis factor- (<i>TNF-</i>) gene expression was upregulated in group III, which was significantly downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05) by treatment with <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> in group IV. On the contrary, the heme oxygenase-1 (<i>HO-1</i>) gene was substantially upregulated in group IV. Our findings imply that the oral consumption of <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> ameliorates AA-induced UC in rats by restoring and reestablishing the mucosal integrity, in addition to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Accordingly, <i>R. aegyptiacum</i> is potentially effective and beneficial in human UC therapy, which needs to be further investigated in future work.",40082206
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Transcriptional reprogramming and microbiome dynamics in garden pea exposed to high pH stress during vegetative stage.,"High soil pH induces the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and nutrient transport, while the enrichment of beneficial microbes (Variovorax, Chaetomium, and Pseudomonas) highlights their potential role in promoting stress adaptation. High soil pH severely impacts plant growth and productivity, yet the transcriptomic changes and microbial dynamics underlying stress adaptation in garden pea (Pisum sativum ssp. hortense) remain unclear. This study demonstrates that high soil pH leads to stunted growth, reduced biomass, impaired photosynthesis, and nutrient status in garden pea. Further, disruption in key nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium indicum, R. leguminosarum, and R. redzepovicii), along with the downregulation of NifA and NifD genes and upregulation of NifH in nodules highlights the critical role of micronutrient balance in legume-microbe symbiosis and a compensatory response to maintain nitrogen status. RNA seq analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, characterized by the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes (e.g., oxidoreductase and glutathione transferase activities, metal ion transporters) and the downregulation of genes related to ammonia-lyase activity and ion binding, reflecting broader disruptions in nutrient homeostasis. KEGG pathway analysis identified enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway, likely interacting with other pathways associated with stress tolerance, metabolic adjustment, and structural reorganization as part of adaptive responses to high pH. Root microbiome analysis showed significant enrichment of Variovorax, Shinella, and Chaetomium, suggesting host-driven recruitment under high pH stress. Stable genera, such as Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Mycobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Paecilomyces, displayed resilience to stress conditions, potentially forming core microbiome components for adaptation to high pH. In a targeted study, inoculation of plants with an enriched microbiome, particularly C. globosum, under high pH conditions improved growth parameters and increased the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas in the roots. It suggests that these bacterial genera may act as helper microbes to C. globosum, collectively promoting stress resilience in pea plants suffering from high pH. These findings provide a foundation for microbiome-aided breeding programs and the development of microbial consortia to enhance the adaptation of pea plants to high pH conditions.",40059228
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",A review-chitosan nanoparticles towards enhancing nutrient use efficiency in crops.,"Global economy relies on agriculture and hence poor nutrient use efficiency of conventional fertilization is not only a problem for the farmers but also for the researchers. Chitin, the natural biopolymer of the world, next to cellulose, on deacetylation yields chitosan, which has potential uses in diverse domains of agricultural sector, including wastewater treatment, pest and disease resistance and in smart nutrient delivery. Chitosan nanomaterials serve as the available nutrient source of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus to plants. It is biocompatible, biodegradable and ecofriendly and hence has no toxic effects on soil and crops. Chitosan with nanoparticles is used as a controlled release fertilizer thereby reducing the application of chemical fertilizers. Chitosan nanoparticles act as a carrier for delivery of ions slowly when required by the crops due to which the nutrient content in many crops gets increased. They aid in enhanced nutrient uptake by triggering the activity of microorganisms and enzymes like alkaline phosphatase, thereby enhancing the availability of nutrients. The nodulation (NOD) gene responsible for rhizobium activity is triggered which plays a major role in nitrogen fixation in legumes. The safety of using chitosan nanoparticles and the economic feasibility has also been addressed in this review. This review explores the potential use of chitosan nanoparticles as nutrient carrier.",40010475

Explosive soil contamination can disrupt microbial communities, leading to microbial abundance and richness changes. This study investigates the microbial diversity of soils and roots from sites with a history of ammunition disposal, aiming to identify organisms that may play a role in bioremediation. Soil and root samples were collected from two types of ammunition disposal (through open burning and open detonation) and unpolluted sites in Machachi, Ecuador, over two years (2022 and 2023). High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (for bacteria) and the ITS region (for fungi and plants) was conducted to obtain taxonomic profiles. There were significant variations in the composition of bacteria, fungi, and plant communities between polluted and unpolluted sites. Bacterial genera such as <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Rhizobium</i> were more abundant in roots, while <i>Candidatus Udaeobacter</i> dominated unpolluted soils. Fungal classes Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes were prevalent across most samples, while Leotiomycetes and Agaricomycetes were also highly abundant in unpolluted samples. Plant-associated reads showed a higher abundance of <i>Poa</i> and <i>Trifolium</i> in root samples, particularly at contaminated sites, and <i>Alchemilla</i>, <i>Vaccinium</i>, and <i>Hypericum</i> were abundant in unpolluted sites. Alpha diversity analysis indicated that bacterial diversity was significantly higher in unpolluted root and soil samples, whereas fungal diversity was not significantly different among sites. Redundancy analysis of beta diversity showed that site, year, and sample type significantly influenced microbial community structure, with the site being the most influential factor. Differentially abundant microbial taxa, including bacteria such as <i>Pseudarthrobacter</i> and fungi such as <i>Paraleptosphaeria</i> and <i>Talaromyces</i>, may contribute to natural attenuation processes in explosive-contaminated soils.

This study introduces a highly effective Rhizobium rhizogenes-mediated transformation system for C. campestris using a pBIN plasmid harboring a Yellow Fluorescence Protein reporter gene. We optimized transformation and regeneration by assessing explant type, media composition, and plant growth regulators. Notably, host plant contact was essential for transgenic shoot regeneration. Over 70% transformation efficiency was achieved using cuttings co-incubated with modified Murashige and Skoog medium and 5 mg/L Benzylaminopurine, followed by transfer to tomato hosts.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Ethylene biosynthesis in legumes: gene identification and expression during early symbiotic stages.,"The final steps of ethylene biosynthesis involve the consecutive activity of two enzymes, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO). These enzymes are encoded by small gene families, which, in the case of legumes, have not been systematically characterized at the level of gene family membership or phylogenetic relationship. Moreover, the absence of consensus nomenclature complicates comparisons within the scientific literature, where authors are addressing the roles of these genes in planta. In this study, we provide a framework in which the ACS and ACO gene family members of several legume species, including the two model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, were systematically annotated, named, and analysed relative to genes from other dicot and monocot model species. A combination of phylogenetic and reciprocal BLAST analyses was used to identify evolutionary relationships among genes, including the identification of orthologous relationships that can inform hypotheses about function. Given the role of ethylene as a negative regulator of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, we queried publicly available RNA-seq expression datasets to obtain an overview of the expression profiles of these genes in the interaction between M. truncatula and its nitrogen-fixing microsymbiont. The resulting evolutionary framework, as well as structural and expression analyses, are intended to facilitate ongoing functional studies in legumes.",39969186
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Role of <i>GmFRI-1</i> in Regulating Soybean Nodule Formation Under Cold Stress.,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, recognized as the most efficient nitrogen assimilation system in ecosystems, is essential for soybean growth, as nodulation provides critical nitrogen to host cells. Soybeans thrive in warm and moist environments. However, they are highly susceptible to low temperatures, which impede the formation and development of root nodules. The genetic basis and molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of nodulation induced by low temperatures remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of soybean roots inoculated with rhizobium at 1 DPI (Day Post Inoculation) under normal or cold treatments. We identified 39 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated genes associated with nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Notably, cold-responsive genes including three <i>FRI</i> (<i>Frigida</i>) family genes were identified among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Further expression pattern analysis of <i>GmFRI-1</i> demonstrated it being significantly responsive to rhizobium inoculation and its highest expression in nodules. Further investigation revealed that overexpression of <i>GmFRI-1</i> led to an increase in the nodule number, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene editing of <i>GmFRI-1</i> suppressed nodule formation. Additionally, <i>GmFRI-1</i> overexpression may regulate soybean nodulation by modulating the expression of <i>GmNIN</i> (NODULE INCEPTION), <i>GmNSP1</i> (nodulation signaling pathway 1), and <i>GmHAP2-2</i> (histone- or haem-associated protein domain) in the nod factor signaling pathway. This study offers new insights into the genetic basis of nodulation regulation under cold stress in legumes and indicates that <i>GmFRI-1</i> may serve as a key regulator of nodule formation under cold stress.",39940650

The rhizosphere microbiome is recruited from the surrounding soil and is known to impact positively on the plant host via enhanced resistance to pathogens, increased nutrient availability, growth stimulation and increased resistance to desiccation. Desert ecosystems harbour a diversity of perennial and annual plant species, generally exhibiting considerable physiological adaptation to the low-water environment. In this study, we explored the rhizosphere bacterial microbiomes associated with selected desert plant species. The rhizosphere bacterial communities of 11 plant species from the central Namib Desert were assessed using 16S rRNA gene-dependent phylogenetic analyses. The rhizosphere microbial community of each host plant species was compared with control soils collected from their immediate vicinity, and with those of all other host plants. Rhizosphere and control soil bacterial communities differed significantly and were influenced by both location and plant species. Rhizosphere-associated genera included 67 known plant growth-promoting taxa, including Rhizobium, Bacillus, Microvirga, Kocuria and Paenibacillus. Other than Kocuria, these genera constituted the 'core' rhizosphere bacterial microbiome, defined as being present in >90% of the rhizosphere communities. Nine of the 11 desert plant species harboured varying numbers and proportions of species-specific microbial taxa. Predictive analyses of functional pathways linked to rhizosphere microbial taxa showed that these were significantly enriched in the biosynthesis or degradation of a variety of substances such as sugars, secondary metabolites, phenolic compounds and antimicrobials. Overall, our data suggest that plant species in the Namib Desert recruit unique taxa to their rhizosphere bacterial microbiomes that may contribute to their resilience in this extreme environment.",39884152
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Regulation of Rhizobial Nodulation Genes by Flavonoid-Independent NodD Supports Nitrogen-Fixing Symbioses With Legumes.,"Rhizobia and legumes form a symbiotic relationship resulting in the formation of root structures known as nodules, where bacteria fix nitrogen. Legumes release flavonoids that are detected by the rhizobial nodulation (Nod) protein NodD, initiating the transcriptional activation of nod genes and subsequent synthesis of Nod Factors (NFs). NFs then induce various legume responses essential for this symbiosis. Although evidence suggests differential regulation of nodD expression and NF biosynthesis during symbiosis, the necessity of this regulation for the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules remains uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the Rlv3841 NodD regulatory domain results in a constitutively active protein (NodD<sub>FI</sub>) capable of activating NF biosynthesis gene expression without the presence of flavonoids. Optimised constitutive expression of nodD<sub>FI</sub> or nodD3 in nodD null mutants led to wild-type levels of nodulation and nitrogen fixation in pea and M. truncatula, respectively, indicating that flavonoid-regulated nodD expression is not essential for supporting symbiosis. These findings illustrate that transcriptional control of flavonoid-independent NodD regulators can be employed to drive NF biosynthesis, which holds potential for engineering symbiosis between rhizobia and cereals equipped with reconstituted NF receptors.",39865396

However, the national average yield remains relatively low, largely because most bean cultivation is undertaken by small-scale farmers. In this context,biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is an effective strategy for improving crop yield. Therefore, it is important to identify novel rhizobial strains well suited to local climatic conditions. This study used Phaseolus vulgarisas a trap plant in soils from three distinct conservation areas (Ponta Grossa, Ortigueira, and Londrina) within Paran State, Brazil. The soil chemical analysis revealed that the pH values in the Ponta Grossa and Ortigueira regions were low, whereas the Ortigueira region exhibited elevated aluminum levels. A total of 94 strains were obtained from the nodules of plants and subjected to analysis for their morphological and genetic properties. No nodules were observed in the Ortigueira region. In the Ponta Grossa region, most of the strains were identified as belonging to the genus Paraburkholderia, whereas all strains from Londrina were identified as Rhizobium. The 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis revealed a high degree of genetic similarity between the Paraburkholderia and Rhizobium strains.

Our study focused on assessing the diversity of bacterial strains present in cowpea nodules when inoculated with soils from six indigenous lands of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Central-Western Brazil, comprising the Cerrado and the Pantanal biomes, which are known for their rich diversity. The DNA profiles (BOX-PCR) of 89 strains indicated great genetic diversity, with 20 groups and 23 strains occupying single positions, and all strains grouped at a final similarity level of only 25%. Further characterization using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a diverse array of bacterial genera associated with the cowpea nodules.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Closed genomes of commercial inoculant rhizobia provide a blueprint for management of legume inoculation.,"Rhizobia are soil bacteria capable of establishing symbiosis within legume root nodules, where they reduce atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> into ammonia and supply it to the plant for growth. Australian soils often lack rhizobia compatible with introduced agricultural legumes, so inoculation with exotic strains has become a common practice for over 50 years. While extensive research has assessed the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing capabilities of these inoculants, their genomics, taxonomy, and core and accessory gene phylogeny are poorly characterized. Furthermore, in some cases, inoculant strains have been developed from isolations made in Australia. It is unknown whether these strains represent naturalized exotic organisms, native rhizobia with a capacity to nodulate introduced legumes, or recombinant strains arising from horizontal transfer between introduced and native bacteria. Here, we describe the complete, closed genome sequences of 42 Australian commercial rhizobia. These strains span the genera, <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Mesorhizobium</i>, <i>Methylobacterium</i>, <i>Rhizobium</i>, and <i>Sinorhizobium</i>, and only 23 strains were identified to species level. Within inoculant strain genomes, replicon structure and location of symbiosis genes were consistent with those of model strains for each genus, except for <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. SRDI969, where the symbiosis genes are chromosomally encoded. Genomic analysis of the strains isolated from Australia showed they were related to exotic strains, suggesting that they may have colonized Australian soils following undocumented introductions. These genome sequences provide the basis for accurate strain identification to manage inoculation and identify the prevalence and impact of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) on legume productivity. Inoculation of cultivated legumes with exotic rhizobia is integral to Australian agriculture in soils lacking compatible rhizobia. The Australian inoculant program supplies phenotypically characterized high-performing strains for farmers but in most cases, little is known about the genomes of these rhizobia. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of symbiosis genes from inoculant strains to native non-symbiotic rhizobia frequently occurs in Australian soils and can impact the long-term stability and efficacy of legume inoculation. Here, we present the analysis of reference-quality genomes for 42 Australian commercial rhizobial inoculants. We verify and classify the genetics, genome architecture, and taxonomy of these organisms. Importantly, these genome sequences will facilitate the accurate strain identification and monitoring of inoculants in soils and plant nodules, as well as enable detection of horizontal gene transfer to native rhizobia, thus ensuring the efficacy and integrity of Australia's legume inoculation program.",39791879

In this study, both -glucuronidase staining and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that both <i>GmbZIP4a</i> and <i>GmbZIP4b</i> are inducible upon rhizobial inoculation. To investigate their roles further, we constructed <i>gmbzip4a</i>/<i>b</i> double mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Nodulation assessments revealed that these double mutants displayed a reduction in the number of infection threads, which subsequently resulted in a decreased nodule number. However, the processes associated with nodule development including nodule fresh weight, structural characteristics, and nitrogenase activity, remained unaffected in the double mutants. Subsequent transcriptome analyses revealed that zeatin biosynthesis was downregulated in <i>gmbzip4a</i>/<i>b</i> mutants post rhizobial inoculation. Supporting these findings, genes associated with cytokinin (CTK) signaling pathway were upregulated in Williams 82 (Wm82), but this upregulation was not observed in the double mutants after rhizobial treatment.

A two years field experiments was carried out and combined with pot experiments to quantify the effects of planting mode, i.e., relay intercropping and monocropping, and genotypes, i.e., supernodulating NTS1007(NTS), Nandou-12(ND) and Guixia-3(GX) on root exudates, rhizobium community structure, nodule development and nitrogen fixation ability. The result demonstrated that, maize-soybean relay strip intercropping not only promoted daidzein and genistein exudates of soybean root to soil but also reshaped the community structure and diversity of nodule endophytic rhizobia. Compared with monocropping, the nodule number significantly decreased in relay strip intercropping soybean, and NTS achieved 97% at soybean five trifoliolate stage. At soybean full bloom stage, despite the nodulation capacity of relay strip intercropping soybean was unrestored, the nodule number, nodule dry weight, nodule diameter and root dry weight were the highest in ND under relay strip intercropping.

This study employed antimicrobial lipopeptide and phytohormone complex powder (L1) prepared from the fermentation broth of the endophytic plant growth promoting bacterium (PGPB) of <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> strain MG-2 to treat <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (<i>C</i>Las)-infected '<i>Citrus reticulata</i> 'Chun Jian' plants. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and PCR were employed for disease detection. The results revealed that after 15 spray-drench treatments with L1 solution, the HLB infection rate decreased from 100 to 50%, the bacterial titer decreased by 51.9% compared with a 27.9% decrease in the control group. L1 treatment triggered the production of reactive oxygen species, increased lignin content, and increased defense enzyme activities (<i>p</i><0.05). Defense-related gene expression significantly increased within 12 h of treatment. In addition, L1 application also promoted plant growth, as evidenced by higher transpiration rates and net photosynthetic rates as well as increased leave or root density. Root flora analysis revealed that the abundances of <i>Burkholderia_thailandensis</i>, <i>unclassified_g_Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia</i>, <i>unclassified_g__Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas_mosselii</i> were 1.64, 1.46, 5.84, and 6.93 times greater, respectively, than those in the control group. The levels of phenylpropanoids, polyketides, lipids, lipid-like molecules, organic acids, and derivatives, significantly increased following L1 treatment (FC>2, <i>p</i><0.05). Additionally, salicylic acid, dihydrojasmonic acid, and isopentenyl adenosine levels in leaves markedly increased. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed that L1 contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin cyclic-lipopeptides (CLPs) as well as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA), <i>indole-3-carboxylic acid</i> and <i>indole-3-carboxaldehyde auxins</i>, <i>N6-</i>entopentenyladenine and t-zeatin-riboside cytokinins, abscisic acid, 1-aminocyclicpanecarboxylic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellin A1, A3 and A4 phytohormones.

Co-inoculation studies performed on a variety of legumes have shown that rhizobia and AMF influence each other when they co-occur in tripartite association and affect host plant nutrition and performance. Although single plant-microbe interactions have been extensively studied, our understanding in the field of tripartite interactions is insufficient and current knowledge cannot predict the symbiotic outcome, which appears to depend on many parameters. In this review we examine the current state of research on the legume-rhizobium-AMF tripartite symbiosis. We investigate the dynamic interaction between the two microsymbionts and the effect of one microbe on the other, both at the physiological and the molecular levels, and the result of dual inoculation on host plant growth, fitness and response to stresses. Rhizobia and AMF interact both extraradically and intraradically, effects on microbe and host plant gene expression levels are observed, AMF positively regulates nodulation, while rhizobia can affect AMF root colonisation either positively or negatively. Factors observed to regulate the establishment and function of the tripartite symbiosis, such as the rhizobia-AMF combination, host plant identity and environmental conditions are discussed.",39748268
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Phosphate addition intensifies the increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emission under nitrogen deposition in wet meadows of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.,"Alpine wet meadows are known as N<sub>2</sub>O sinks due to nitrogen (N) limitation. However, phosphate addition and N deposition can modulate this limitation, and little is known about their combinative effects on N<sub>2</sub>O emission from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in wet meadows. This study used natural wet meadow as the control treatment (CK) and conducted experiments with N (CON<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> addition, N15), P (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> addition, P15), and their combinations (CON<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> addition, N15P15) to investigate how N and P supplementation affected soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in wet meadow of QTP. Contrary to previous studies on grasslands, the effect of phosphate addition treatment on soil N<sub>2</sub>O flux was not detectable during the growing seasons of 2019 and 2020. Over a span of two years, the N addition treatment significantly increased the N<sub>2</sub>O flux by 3.45 gm<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> due to increased soil N availability. Noticeably, phosphate addition intensified the effect of N deposition treatment on soil N<sub>2</sub>O flux with high significance in the early growth season of 2020. This augmentation can be attributed to the alleviation of limiting factors imposed by plants and microorganisms on soil N and P, fostering the mineralization and decomposition of litter and soil nutrients by microorganisms. Consequently, the results showed that total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were the main controls on soil N<sub>2</sub>O emission under N and P addition. In addition, redundancy analysis showed that the relative abundance of <i>NirK</i> genes in soil microorganisms (<i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Devosia</i>, <i>Ochrobactrum</i>, <i>Alcaligenes</i>, <i>Rhizobium</i>) is the main factor affecting N<sub>2</sub>O flux and available nitrogen. We project that if nutrient input continues to increase, the main limiting factor of soil will change from N restriction to P restriction due to the unique microbial nitrogen conversion process in the alpine meadow, significantly increasing N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Consequently, the heightened contribution of alpine wet meadows to global warming and ozone depletion hinges on the dynamics of nutrient input regimes, spotlighting the urgent need for informed environmental management strategies.",39744388
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Great diverse rhizobial community nodulating <i>Astragalus mongholicus</i> in the northeastern region of China.,"<i>Astragalus mongholicus</i> Bunge is an important medicinal legume species widely cultivated in northeastern China (NEC) and northwestern China (NWC) and can establish a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobial strains. However, there are limited reports comparing the genetic diversity, differentiation, and gene flow of rhizobial strains associated with this plant in different geographic regions. We used multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) to investigate the phylogeny and genetic diversity of rhizobia and to estimate their intra- and inter-regional gene flow and genetic differentiation based on the analysis of concatenated core genes (<i>recA</i>, <i>atpD</i>, and <i>glnII</i>) and the critical symbiotic gene <i>nodC</i>. We isolated eight known and three novel genospecies representing four genera, among which <i>Rhizobium yanglingense</i> was the most predominant microsymbiont. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a highly diverse rhizobial community nodulating <i>Astragalus mongholicus</i> in NEC, consisting of the four genera <i>Rhizobium</i>, <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>, <i>Sinorhizobium</i>, and <i>Mesorhizobium</i>. This community differed markedly from the rhizobial community found in NWC. Various rhizobial genospecies with different symbiotic gene <i>nodC</i> sequences were capable of nodulating <i>A. mongholicus</i> in NEC. Therefore, <i>A. mongholicus</i> exhibits promiscuity in its association with symbionts in the natural environment, showing no strong preference for either the species-defining core genes or the symbiotic genes of rhizobia. We also found that the Glyco_tranf_GTA_type superfamily (Glycosyltransferase family A) is the most highly conserved and essential domain in the NodC protein, which is encoded by the symbiotic <i>nodC</i> gene, across nodulating rhizobia. In addition, we found independent genetic differentiation among rhizobial communities geographically, and the frequency of gene flow among microsymbionts between NEC and NWC was low. We speculate that the formation of the highly diverse rhizobial community in NEC resulted from the independent evolution of each ancestral lineage. This diversity likely arose from intraregional genetic differentiation driven by mutations rather than recombination. Ecogeographical isolation between NEC and NWC restricted inter-regional genetic drift and gene flow. Therefore, intraregional genetic differentiation is the major evolutionary force underlying the genetic diversity of rhizobia.",39735190

It cannot, however, nodulate soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), one of the world's most important crops. Here, we constructed a highly saturated genome-wide transposon library of a P. phymatum strain and employed a transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) approach to investigate the underlying genetic mechanisms of symbiotic incompatibility between P. phymatum and soybean. Soybean seedlings inoculated with the P. phymatum Tn-seq library display nodules on the roots that are mainly occupied by different mutants in a gene, nodS, coding for a methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of nodulation factors. The construction of a nodS deletion strain and a complemented mutant confirms that nodS is responsible for the nodulation-incompatibility of P. phymatum with soybean. Moreover, infection tests with different host plants reveal that NodS is necessary for optimal nodulation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), but it is not required for nodulation of its natural host Mimosa pudica. In conclusion, our results suggest that NodS is involved in determining nodulation specificity of P. phymatum.",39730742

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Agropine-type rolA modulates ROS homeostasis in an auxin-dependent manner in rolA-expressing cell cultures of Rubia cordifolia L.,"Long-term cultured calli may experience a biosynthetic shift due to the IAA-dependent expression of the rolA gene, which also affects ROS metabolism. The ""hairy root"" syndrome is caused by the root-inducing Ri-plasmid of Rhizobiumrhizogenes, also known as Agrobacteriumrhizogenes. The Ri-plasmid contains genes known as rol genes or root oncogenic loci, which promote root development. The important implications of the rolA gene from the T-DNA include reduced plant size, resistance to infections, and the activation of specialised metabolism. Nevertheless, rolA does not belong to the plast gene group because its function is still uncertain. Recent investigations have shown two important effects of the rolA gene. First, the production of secondary metabolites has changed in long-term cultivated rolA-transgenic calli of Rubiacordifolia L. Second, the expression of both the rolA and rolB genes has a strong auxin-dependent antagonistic effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. In this work, we attempted to elucidate two rolA gene phenomena: what caused the secondary metabolism of long-term cultured calli to change? How does the individual expression of the rolA gene affect ROS homeostasis? We analysed SNPs in the 5' untranslated region and coding region of the rolA gene. These mutations do not affect the known essential amino acids of the RolA proteins. Notably, in the promoter of the rolA gene, an ACTTTA motif for auxin-mediated transcription factors was identified. Using two separate cell cultures, we demonstrated the strong auxin dependence of rolA gene expression. The expression of genes involved in ROS metabolism decreased in response to an auxin-mediated increase in rolA gene expression. Two assumptions can be made. The long-term cultivation of calli may cause changes in the hormonal state of the culture over time, which may modulate the action of the RolA protein. Moreover, auxin-dependent expression of the rolA gene led to a decrease in ROS metabolism. It can be assumed that the antagonistic interaction between rolA and rolB prevents strong rolB-induced auxin sensitivity and oxidative bursts to balance the cell state.",39714533

Stress response proteins including small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were previously shown to be differentially regulated in bacteroids induced by <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> bv. viciae UPM791 in different hosts. In this work, we undertook a functional analysis of the host-dependent sHSP RLV_1399. A <i>rlv_1399-</i>deleted mutant strain was impaired in the symbiotic performance with peas but not with lentil plants. Expression of <i>rlv_1399</i> gene was induced under microaerobic conditions in a FnrN-dependent manner consistent with the presence of an anaerobox in its regulatory region. Overexpression of this sHSP improves the viability of bacterial cultures following exposure to hydrogen peroxide and to cationic nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) antimicrobial peptides. Co-purification experiments have identified proteins related to nitrogenase synthesis, stress response, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and to other relevant cellular functions as potential substrates for RLV_1399 in pea bacteroids. These results, along with the presence of unusually high number of copies of <i>shsp</i> genes in rhizobial genomes, indicate that sHSPs might play a relevant role in the adaptation of the bacteria against stress conditions inside their host.IMPORTANCEThe identification and analysis of the mechanisms involved in host-dependent bacterial stress response is important to develop optimal <i>Rhizobium</i>/legume combinations to maximize nitrogen fixation for inoculant development and might have also applications to extend nitrogen fixation to other crops. The data presented in this work indicate that sHSP RLV_1399 is part of the bacterial stress response to face specific stress conditions offered by each legume host. The identification of a wide diversity of sHSP potential targets reveals the potential of this protein to protect essential bacteroid functions. The finding that nitrogenase is the most abundant RLV_1399 substrate suggests that this protein is required to obtain an optimal nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.",39714151

The following inoculants were used: Nitragina IUNG, Nitragina Biofood, Nitroflora Mycoflor, Rhizobium Bio-Gen, and HiStick<sup></sup> Soy. The study was carried out on plants grown in pots in an open foil tunnel or glasshouse conditions. Experimental seeds were inoculated before sowing, while the control ones were not. Physiological and biochemical analyses involved the leaves, and gene expression was investigated in the roots. The bacterial inoculants significantly affected individual parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence. The highest photochemical efficiency was induced by Nitroflora Mycoflor, which also activated nitrate reductase to the greatest extent. Nitragina IUNG most strongly stimulated accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, facilitated formation of the greatest number of nodules, and improved seed yield per plant in comparison with the control and other inoculants. Of the studied nodulation genes, NIC1 showed the strongest expression following HiStick<sup></sup>Soy treatment. Nitragina Biofood and Nitragina IUNG most significantly reduced the expression of all studied genes. Expression of NOD21 and NORKb exposed to other inoculants was the same as in the control plants. High content of hydrogen peroxide can be considered a marker of the inoculant ability to increase nodulation and yield of soybean.

Understanding genetic mechanisms of plant transformation remains crucial for biotechnology. This is particularly relevant for roses and other woody ornamentals that exhibit recalcitrant behavior in transformation procedures. Rhizobium rhizogenes-mediated transformation leading to hairy root (HR) formation provides an excellent model system to study transformation processes and host-pathogen interactions. Therefore, this study aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with HR formation and explore their relationship with adventitious root (AR) formation in rose as a model for woody ornamentals. A diversity panel of 104 in vitro grown rose genotypes was transformed with R. rhizogenes strain ATCC 15834 carrying a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Phenotypic data on callus and root formation were collected for laminae and petioles. A genome-wide association study using 23,419 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers revealed significant QTLs on chromosomes one and two for root formation traits. Five key genomic regions explained 12.0-26.9% of trait variability, with some peaks overlapping previously reported QTLs for AR formation. This genetic overlap was supported by weak to moderate correlations between HR and AR formation traits, particularly in petioles. Candidate gene identification through literature review and transcriptomic data analysis revealed ten candidate genes involved in bacterial response, hormone signaling, and stress responses.

Rhizobiaceae is a key biomarker taxa affected by root hair related mutants. We isolated and sequenced 1479 root associated microbes, and confirmed that several Rhizobium strains presented stress-alleviating activities.

The taxonomy of rhizogenic agrobacteria has undergone several changes in the past and is still somewhat controversial. While the classification of Agrobacterium strains was initially mainly based on phenotypic properties and the symptoms they induced on plants, more and more genetic information has been used along the years to infer Agrobacterium taxonomy. This has led to the definition of the so-called Agrobacterium tumefaciens species complex (Atsc), which comprises several genomospecies. Interestingly, the rhizogenic Agrobacterium strains are found in several of these genomospecies. Nevertheless, even up until today Agrobacterium strains, and in particular rhizogenic agrobacteria, are prone to misclassification and considerable confusion in literature. In this study, we evaluated different phylogenetic analysis approaches for their use to improve Agrobacterium taxonomy and tried to gain more insight in the classification of strains into this complex genus, with a particular focus on rhizogenic agrobacteria. The genome sequence analysis of 580 assemblies, comprising Agrobacterium, Allorhizobium and Rhizobium strains demonstrated that phylogenies based on single marker genes, such as the commonly used 16S rRNA and recA gene, do not provide sufficient resolution for proper delineation of the different genomospecies within the Atsc.

Herein, soil that had been treated with fertilizer and rhizobium for 10 years was collected to investigate the characteristics of P-mobilizing bacterial communities. Five treatments were included: no fertilization (CK), phosphorus fertilizer (P), urea+potassium fertilizer (NK), NPK, and PK+Bradyrhizobium japonicum 5821 (PK+R). The soybean nodule dry weight was highest in the P treatment (1.93g), while the soybean yield peaked in the PK+R treatment (3025.33kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). The abundance of the pqqC gene increased in the rhizosphere soil at the flowering-podding stage and in the bulk soil at the maturity stage under the P treatment, while its abundance increased in the bulk soil at the flowering-podding stage and in the rhizosphere soil at the maturity stage under the PK+R treatment. The abundance of the phoD gene was enhanced in the bulk soil at the flowering-podding stage under the PK+R treatment. The Shannon and Ace indexes of pqqC- and phoD-harboring bacteria were higher in the rhizosphere soil at maturity under the PK+R treatment compared to other treatments. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the neutral community model and co-occurrence pattern demonstrated that the application of P fertilizer alone led to an increase in the distribution and dynamic movement of pqqC-harboring bacteria, but resulted in a decrease in complexity of network structure. On the other hand, rhizobium inoculation enhanced the distribution and dynamic movement of phoD-harboring bacteria, as well as the stability and complexity of the network structure. Pseudomonas and Nitrobacter, as well as Steptomyces, Stella, and Nonomuraea, may be crucial genera regulating the composition and function of pqqC- and phoD-harboring communities, respectively.

It has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with Rhizobium, enriching marginal soils with this essential nutrient and reducing the need for artificial fertilizers. Additionally, lupine produces seeds with a high protein content, making it valuable for animal feed production. However, drought negatively affects lupine development, its mutualistic relationship with bacteria, and overall yield. To understand how lupine responds to this stress, global transcriptome sequencing was conducted, along with in-depth biochemical, chromatography, and microscopy analyses of roots subjected to drought. The results presented here contribute to strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of water deficit on lupine growth and development. Based on RNA-seq, drought-specific genes were identified and annotated to biological pathways involved in phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling, lipid metabolism, and redox homeostasis. Our findings indicate that drought-induced disruption of redox balance characterized by the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, coincided with the accumulation of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, such as phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX). This disruption also led to modifications in lipid homeostasis, including increased levels of triacylglycerols (TAG) and free fatty acids (FFA), along with a decrease in polar lipid content. Additionally, the stress response involved alterations in the transcriptional regulation of the linolenic acid metabolism network, resulting in changes in the composition of fatty acids containing 18 carbons. The first comprehensive global transcriptomic profiles of lupine roots, combined with the identification of key stress-responsive molecules, represent a significant advancement in understanding lupine's responses to abiotic stress. The increased expression of the 12DESATURASE gene and enhanced PLD activity lead to higher level of linoleic acid (18:2), which is subsequently oxidized by LOX, resulting in membrane damage and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Oxidative stress elevates the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT), while the conversion of FFAs into TAGs provides protection against ROS. This research offers valuable molecular and biochemical candidates with significant potential to enhance drought tolerance . It enables innovative strategies in lupine breeding and crop improvement to address critical agricultural challenges.",39506671

Rhizobacterial biostimulants that secrete 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase and enhance crop resilience and yield can serve as a potential sustainable solution. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of ACC-deaminase producing rhizobacteria (ACCD) isolated from cold deserts of the Indian trans-Himalayas and their efficacy to improve crop resilience and productivity under diverse climatic conditions. Thirty four efficient ACCD showed ACC deaminase activity ranging from 4.9 to 24484.3nM -ketobutyrate/h/mg/protein. These strains also exhibited broad-spectrum plant growth promotion (PGP) attributes, including tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) solubilization ranging from 2.4 to 687.5g/ml, siderophore production ranging from 62 to 224% and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-like auxin production ranging from 0.9 to 88.2g/ml. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of efficient strains showed their belonging to 10 genera, including Acinetobacter, Agrobacterium, Arthrobacter, Cellulomonas, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Neomicrococcus, Priestia, Pseudomonas, and Rhizobium. Among these, Pseudomonas was the dominant genus with high ACC-deaminase activity and multiple PGP traits. These strains also showed growth under various stressed culture conditions, including acidity/alkalinity, different temperatures, desiccation, and salinity. Field applications of 4 efficient and stress-tolerant ACCD, including Pseudomonas geniculata, P. migulae, Priestia aryabhattai, and Rhizobium nepotum with reduced NPK dose under two different temperate climate conditions showed a significant improvement in growth and productivity of crops such as garlic, pea, potato, and wheat in slightly acidic soils and maize in saline-sodic alkaline soils.

Ghee is prepared using traditional methods and has substantial potential as a reservoir of probiotic microorganisms. Previous research delved into isolating and identifying lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in Kermanshahi through culture and PCR sequencing. This study seeks to elucidate the microbial profiles and diversity within Kermanshahi using culture, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing methodologies. Twenty samples of Kermanshahi oil were meticulously gathered from diverse locales across Kermanshah province. These samples were cultivated under specialized conditions in MRS and M17 environments spanning 24 to 72h. Following DNA extraction, amplification of the 16SrRNA gene sequences was performed, culminating in sequencing for conclusive identification of the isolates. Furthermore, the DGGE technique was directly employed to separate and identify various species present in the oil samples utilizing bioinformatics software. Sequencing outcomes revealed a diverse array of microorganisms among the isolates, with Lactobacillus constituting 43%, Streptococcus comprising 27.6%, Enterococcus at 4.61%, and yeasts at 7.6%. Other species exhibited lower frequencies, encompassing Rhizobium, Bacillus coagulans, and Staphylococcus hominis. The isolation of a diverse spectrum of probiotic microorganisms underscores their potential utility in the realm of industrial dairy product production.

Both partners must maintain an efficient nutrient exchange to ensure a successful symbiosis. This mini-review highlights the intricate phosphate and iron uptake and homeostasis processes taking place in legumes during their interactions with rhizobia. The coordination of transport and homeostasis of these nutrients in host plants and rhizobia ensures an efficient nitrogen fixation process and nutrient use. We discuss the genetic machinery controlling the uptake and homeostasis of these nutrients in the absence of rhizobia and under symbiotic conditions with this soil bacterium. We also highlight the genetic impact of the availability of phosphate and iron to coordinate the activation of the genetic programs that allow legumes to engage in symbiosis with rhizobia. Finally, we discuss how the transcription factor phosphate starvation response might be a crucial genetic element to integrate the plant's needs of nitrogen, iron and phosphate while interacting with rhizobia. Understanding the coordination of the iron and phosphate uptake and homeostasis can lead us to better harness the ecological benefits of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, even under adverse environmental conditions.",39460549

AMF can also benefit plants through affecting the rhizosphere microbial community, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using Rhizophagus intraradices as a model AMF species, we assessed how AMF influences the bacterial composition and functional diversity through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics analysis in the rhizosphere of aluminum-sensitive soybean that were inoculated with pathogenic fungus Nigrospora oryzae and phosphorus-solubilizing fungus Talaromyces verruculosus in an acidic soil. The inoculation of R. intraradices, N. oryzae and T. verruculosus didn't have a significant influence on the levels of soil C, N, and P, or various plant characteristics such as seed weight, crude fat and protein content. However, their inoculation affected the structure, function and nutrient dynamics of the resident bacterial community. The co-inoculation of T. verruculosus and R. intraradices increased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas psychrotolerans, which was capable of N-fixing and was related to cry-for-help theory (plants signal for beneficial microbes when under stress), within the rhizosphere. R. intraradices increased the expression of metabolic pathways associated with the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which was known to enhance plant resistance under adverse environmental conditions. The inoculation of N. oryzae stimulated the stress response inside the soil environment by enriching the polyene macrolide antifungal antibiotic-producing bacterial genus Streptomyces in the root endosphere and upregulating two antibacterial activity metabolic pathways associated with steroid biosynthesis pathways in the rhizosphere. Although inoculation of pathogenic fungus N. oryzae enriched Bradyrhizobium and increased soil urease activity, it had no significant effects on biomass and N content of soybean. Lastly, the host niches exhibited differences in the composition of the bacterial community, with most N-fixing bacteria accumulating in the endosphere and Rhizobium vallis only detected in the endosphere. Our findings demonstrate that intricate interactions between AMF, associated core fungi, and the soybean root-associated ecological niches co-mediate the regulation of soybean growth, the dynamics of rhizosphere soil nutrients, and the composition, function, and metabolisms of the root-associated microbiome in an acidic soil.",39439005

In this work, the transcriptional regulator RosR of Rhizobium ruizarguesonis, which regulates the synthesis of EPS, was overproduced in a pHC60 plasmid and expressed in the RCAM 1026 strain. This resulted in an improved production of EPS by this recombinant strain. Comparative analysis of the inoculation of pea Pisum sativum plants with R. ruizarguesonis pHC60-rosR and strain carrying the empty plasmid revealed an essential increase in the number of nodules, root length and biomass in plants inoculated with this EPS-overproducing strain. It demonstrates that the enhanced EPS synthesis by rhizobia may stimulate plant root colonization and subsequent nodule formation in pea plants. The influence of enhanced EPS synthesis in rhizobia on colonizing activity was also estimated in non-legume plant tomato Solanum lycopersicum. Our findings shown the increased colonization of the root surface and stimulation of the shoot biomass of inoculated plants. Inoculation of pea and tomato with EPS-overproducing rhizobial strain essentially increased plant resistance to phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium culmorum and F. oxysporum in both legume and non-legume plants, demonstrating a significant biocontrol effect of this recombinant strain. Furthermore, we have identified the PsLYK10 gene that encodes a putative EPS receptor in P. sativum, although no significant effect of PsLYK10 overexpression on nodulation in legume (pea P. sativum) and colonization of roots of non-legume plants by rhizobia was found compared to enhanced production of EPS by rhizobia.",39432167
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Preinoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum enhances the salt tolerance of Glycine max seedlings by regulating polyamine metabolism in roots.,"Rhizobia are common symbiotic microorganisms in the root system of leguminous plants that can usually provide nitrogen to the host through nitrogen fixation. Studies have shown that rhizobium-preinoculated soybean plants usually exhibit improved salt tolerance, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this paper, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that preinoculation with rhizobia affected polyamine (PA) metabolism in soybean roots. The assay of PA contents showed that preinoculation with rhizobia significantly increased the putrescine (Put) content in roots and leaves during short-term salt treatment (0-5d). Long-term salt treatment (5-7d) resulted in a high Put content and significantly increased Spm and Spd contents, resulting in a rapid increase in the Put/(Spd+Spm) ratio (0-5d) and subsequent decrease. Moreover, rhizobium preinoculation of soybean plants resulted in increased contents of conjugated and bound PAs under salt stress. Further transcriptome sequencing, PA contents, PA synthase expression and activity analysis revealed that GmADC may be a key gene related to salt tolerance in rhizobium-preinoculated soybean plants, and the GmADC-overexpressing soybean hairy-root composite plants exhibited less ROS damage, lower Cl<sup>-</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ratios and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios, and stabilized ion homeostasis. Taken together, preinoculation with rhizobia increased the expression level and enzyme activity of arginine decarboxylase (ADC) in soybean roots, increased the content of Put in roots and leaves, and increased the content of conjugated and bound PAs in soybean plants, thereby alleviating the oxidative and ionic injuries of soybean plants and enhancing the salt tolerance.",39405999

A total of 615 rhizobial isolates were obtained from root nodules of the trapping plants and characterized genetically and symbiotically. The isolates discriminated into 43 genotypes by PCR-RFLP of IGS DNA. Multiple locus sequence analysis based on 16S rRNA, <i>recA</i>, <i>atpD, dnaK</i>, and <i>rpoB</i> genes placed them into eight clusters corresponding to species <i>R. acaciae</i>, <i>R. anhuiense</i>, <i>R. binae, R. bangladeshense, R. hidalgonense,</i> and three suspected novel populations of <i>Rhizobium</i> genosp. I-III. <i>R. acaciae</i> was the dominant group (52.5%) followed by <i>R. anhuiense</i> (30.7%). The other species were minor groups. Based on <i>nodC</i> phylogeny, all of them were the symbiovar viciae. All the tested strains showed efficient symbiotic N<sub>2</sub> fixation on pea plants, in which WLB27, WCB18, and WNY29 presented the best PGP effects. Some of the tested strains had better IAA production, with WCB18 as the best producer (64.556mg/L). Their distribution was mainly affected by soil available phosphorus, available potassium, and effective nitrogen. According to the results of symbiotic effect and resistance tests, strains of WLB27, WCB18, and WNY29 were selected as candidates for creating inoculants.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae facilitate rhizobia dispersal and nodulation in legumes.,"In soil ecosystems, rhizobia occupy the rhizosphere of legume roots to form nodules, a process triggered by microbial recognition of specific root-derived signals (i.e. flavonoids). However, soil conditions can limit bacterial motility, restricting signal perception to the area directly influenced by roots. Legumes, like most plants of agricultural interest, associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whose hyphae develop extensively in the soil, potentially providing an effective dispersal network for rhizobia. We hypothesized that mycelial networks of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play a role in signal transmission and act as a highway, enabling rhizobia to migrate from distant soil to the roots of leguminous plants. Using in vitro and greenhouse microcosm systems, we demonstrated that Rhizophagus irregularis helps Shinorhizobium meliloti to migrate towards the legume Medicago truncatula, triggering nodulation, a mechanism absent without the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus. Metabolomics analysis revealed eight flavonoids unique to the compartment containing extraradical hyphae of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus linked to M. truncatula roots, associated with Sinorhizobium meliloti growth and nod gene expression. Rhizobia plated on the extraradical hyphae connecting two plants (the legume M. truncatula and non-legume Solanum tuberosum) by a common mycelium network, showed preference for the legume, suggesting the chemoattraction by specific signals transported by the fungus connected to the legume. Simultaneously, S. meliloti stimulated the cytoplasmic/protoplasmic flow in the hyphae, likely increasing the release of nutrients and signals. Our results highlight the importance of extraradical hyphae (i.e. the mycorrhizal pathway) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the migration of rhizobia over long distances to the roots, leading to nodulation.",39325968

Xenopus spp. (African clawed frogs) are well-established model organisms, and standard husbandry protocols, including use of antibiotics, may affect experimental outcomes by altering bacterial assemblages. It is therefore essential to improve knowledge of Xenopus bacterial community characteristics and inheritance. We undertook bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and source tracking of a captive Xenopus laevis colony, including various life stages and environmental samples across multiple aquarium systems. Tank environments supported the most complex bacterial communities, while egg jelly bacteria were the most diverse of frog life stages; tadpole bacterial communities were relatively simple. Rhizobium (Proteobacteria) and Chryseobacterium (Bacteroidota) were dominant in tadpoles, whereas Chryseobacterium, Vogesella (Proteobacteria), and Acinetobacter (Proteobacteria) were common in females. Tadpoles received approximately two-thirds of their bacteria via vertical transmission, though 23 genera were differentially abundant between females and tadpoles. Female frog skin appears to select for specific taxa, and while tadpoles inherit a proportion of their skin bacteria from females via the egg, they support a distinct and less diverse community. The outcomes of this study suggest the impacts of breaking the bacterial transmission chain with antibiotic treatment should be considered when raising tadpoles for experimental purposes.",39317670

Here, we explored the intraspecies variability in T3SS-triggered nodulation within Aeschynomene evenia and investigated transcriptomic responses that occur during this symbiosis. Furthermore, Bradyrhizobium strains having different effector sets were tested on A. evenia mutants altered in various symbiotic signalling genes. We identified the A. evenia accession N21/PI 225551 as appropriate for deciphering the T3SS-dependent process. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of A. evenia N21 roots inoculated with ORS3257 strain and its ernA mutant revealed genes differentially expressed, including some involved in plant defences and auxin signalling. In the other A. evenia accession N76, all tested strains nodulated the AeCRK mutant but not the AeNIN and AeNSP2 mutants, indicating a differential requirement of these genes for T3SS-dependent nodulation. Furthermore, the effects of AePOLLUX, AeCCaMK and AeCYCLOPS mutations differed between the strains. Notably, ORS86 nodulated these three mutant lines and required for this both ErnA and Sup3.

In this study, offspring lines of Rhizobium rhizogenes naturally transformed oilseed rape (Brassica napus), i.e., A11 and B3 (termed root-inducing (Ri) lines), were investigated for osmotic stress resilience. Under polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) 10% (w/v)-induced osmotic stress, the Ri lines, particularly A11, had less severe leaf wilting, higher stomatal conductance (8.2 times more than WT), and a stable leaf transpiration rate (about 2.9mmolm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). Although the leaf relative water content and leaf water potential responded similarly to PEG treatment between the Ri lines and WT, a significant reduction of the turgid weight to dry weight ratio in A11 and B3 indicated a greater capacity of osmoregulation in the Ri lines. Moreover, the upregulation of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins genes (PIPs) in roots and downregulation of these genes in leaves of the Ri lines implied a better maintenance of hydraulic integrity in relation to the WT. Furthermore, the Ri lines had greater total antioxidant capacity (TAC) than the WT under PEG stress. Collectively, the enhanced tolerance of the Ri lines to PEG-induced osmotic stress could be attributed to the greater osmoregulation capacity, better maintenance of hydraulic integrity, and greater TAC than the WT.

Understanding the regulatory components in the R. giardinii A3AY_RS01 genes might also lead to the creation of innovative ways for increasing the effectiveness of nitrogen fixation in other agriculturally important bacteria. Therefore, this study was aimed to predict regulatory element of R. giardinii DNA-binding response regulator A3AY_RS01 genes.

Motif 1 was revealed as the common promoter motif for all of R. giardinii A3AY_RS01 genes that serves as binding sites for TFs involved in the expression regulation of these genes. Hence, it was revealed that Motif 1 may serve as the binding site chiefly for Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) transcription factor family to regulate expression of A3AY_RS01 genes. High CpG density in the promoter than body regions were observed for most of the genes except for A3AY_RS0102950, A3AY_RS0120195 and A3AY_RS0131150 genes. Nonetheless, promoter areas were richer than body regions in both techniques. MV1 motif can serve as a binding site for the Fur transcription factor gene family in R. giardinii to regulate the expression of R. giardinii A3AY_RS01 genes.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Chitin nanofibers promote rhizobial symbiotic nitrogen fixation in Lotus japonicus.,"Chitin, an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine polymer, has multiple functions in living organisms, including the induction of disease resistance and growth promotion in plants. In addition, chitin oligosaccharides (COs) are used as the backbone of the signaling molecule Nod factor secreted by soil bacteria rhizobia to establish a mutual symbiosis with leguminous plants. Nod factor perception triggers host plant responses for rhizobial symbiosis. In this study, the effects of chitins on rhizobial symbiosis were examined in the leguminous plants Lotus japonicus and soybean. Chitin nanofiber (CNF), retained with polymeric structures, and COs elicited calcium spiking in L. japonicus roots expressing a nuclear-localized cameleon reporter. Shoot growth and symbiotic nitrogen fixation were significantly increased by CNF but not COs in L.japonicus and soybean. However, treatments with chitin and cellulose nanofiber, structurally similar polymers to CNF, did not affect shoot growth and nitrogen fixation in L.japonicus. Transcriptome analysis also supported the specific effects of CNF on rhizobial symbiosis in L.japonicus. Although chitins comprise the same monosaccharides and nanofibers share similar physical properties, only CNF can promote rhizobial nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants. Taking the advantages on physical properties, CNF could be a promising material for improving legume yield by enhancing rhizobial symbiosis.",39173792

A S. fredii cystathionine -lyase (CSE) mutant deficient in H2S synthesis showed early nodule senescence characterized by reduced nitrogenase activity, structural changes in nodule cells, and accelerated bacteroid death. In parallel, the CSE mutant facilitated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elicited antioxidant responses. We observed that H2S-mediated persulfidation of cysteine C31/C80 in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and C32 in APX2-modulated enzyme activity, thereby participating in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detoxification and delaying nodule senescence. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant upregulation of GmMYB128, an MYB transcription factor (TF), in the CSE mutant nodules. Functional analysis through overexpression and RNAi lines of GmMYB128 demonstrated its role as a positive regulator in nodule senescence. MYB128-OE inoculated with the CSE mutant strain exhibited a reduction in nitrogenase activity and a significant increase in DD15 expression, both of which were mitigated by NaHS addition. Changes at the protein level encompassed the activation of plant defenses alongside turnover in carbohydrates and amino acids. Our results suggest that H2S plays an important role in maintaining efficient symbiosis and preventing premature senescence of soybean nodules.",39133896

It is renowned for its specific nodulation with rhizobia. Despite its significance, studies on chickpea-nodulating rhizobia often focused on small-scale investigations within restricted geographical areas. This study delves into the population, genetic diversity, and symbiotic efficiency of chickpea-nodulating rhizobia in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India. The study revealed a low population of chickpea rhizobia (ranging from 11 to 565 cells/g dry soil) across the examined area. Only three samples exhibited a population exceeding 300 cells/g, emphasizing the potential need for inoculation of rhizobia with efficient and competitive strains. Correlation analysis highlighted a significant positive correlation between rhizobial population and organic carbon content, among various soil parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and organic carbon content. Among the 79 presumptive rhizobia isolated from 24 IGP locations, 61 successfully nodulated chickpea cultivar Pusa 362. 16S rRNA gene sequencing categorized 54 isolates as Mesorhizobium, four as Rhizobium, and three as Ensifer. Genetic diversity assessed by BOX-PCR revealed sixteen distinct banding patterns, underscoring substantial variability among the strains. The strains exhibited plant growth-promoting activities, salt tolerance up to 3% NaCl, and pH tolerance between 4 and 10. Six symbiotically efficient strains were identified based on their positive impact on nodulation and dry biomass.

Rhizobial strains exhibit specificity towards host plants and vary in their capacity to fix nitrogen. The increasing interest in rhizobia diversity has prompted studies of their phylogenetic relations. Molecular identification of <i>Rhizobium</i> is quite complex, requiring multiple gene markers to be analysed to distinguish strains at the species level or to predict their host plant. In this research, 50 rhizobia isolates were obtained from the root nodules of five different <i>Pisum sativum</i> L. genotypes (""Bagoo"", ""Respect"", ""Astronaute"", ""Lina DS"", and ""Egle DS""). All genotypes were growing in the same field, where ecological farming practices were applied, and no commercial rhizobia inoculants were used.

Therefore, lentil seeds were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) (15%), sorbitol (6%), and distilled water, and none pretreated lentils (Lens culinaris) were used as control. The seeds were kept in these solutions for 24h, then dried on toweling paper for 24h, and used for the experiment. For nodule microbiota analysis, the plant root was divided into two equal parts, upper and lower, according to the root length and all nodules were collected from each region. According to the results, it was observed that emergence and flowering started late in the control compared to other seed priming treatments. Sorbitol application was found to provide advantages in terms of germination and seedling development. PEG and distilled water (DW) treatments showed an increase in total phenolic component activity; however, no significant change was observed in DPPH radical scavenging activity. Amplicon-based metagenomic analysis revealed that sorbitol and distilled water were the seed priming solutions altering the species diversity, especially Rhizobium sp. as the genus. In the comparison of samples taken from different parts of the root nodules, more Rhizobium sp. as a genus and Rhizobium leguminosarum as the species were found in the nodules collected from the top of the root.

Localized fertilization of beneficial microbes has potential advantages in achieving higher productivity, but the underlying biological mechanisms of interactions between rhizospheric microorganisms and the related metabolic cycle remain poorly characterized. Here, an integrative analysis of microbiomes with non-targeted metabolomics was performed on 30 soil samples of rhizosphere, root surrounding, and bulk soils from flue-cured tobacco under continuous and non-continuous monocropping systems. The analysis was conducted using UPLC-MS/MS platforms and high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS gene. The microbial inoculant consisted of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>B. velezensis,</i> and <i>B. licheniformis</i> at the ratio of 1:1:1 in effective microbial counts, improved the cured leaf yield and disease resistance of tobacco, and enhanced nicotine and nitrogen contents of tobacco leaves. The bacterial taxa <i>Rhizobium</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Sphingomonadaceae</i>, and <i>Burkholderiaceae</i> of the phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i> accumulated in high relative abundance and were identified as biomarkers following the application of the microbial inoculant. Under continuous monocropping, metabolomics demonstrated that the application of the microbial inoculant significantly affected the soil metabolite spectrum, and the differential metabolites were significantly enriched to the synthesis and degradation of nicotine (nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from nicotinic acid).

Salt-tolerant alfalfa may display unique adaptations in association with rhizobium under salt stress. To elucidate inoculation effects on salt-tolerant alfalfa under salt stress, this study leveraged a salt-tolerant alfalfa population selected through two cycles of recurrent selection under high salt stress. After experiencing 120-day salt stress, mRNA was extracted from 8 random genotypes either grown in 0 or 8 dS/m salt stress with or without inoculation by Ensifer meliloti. Results showed 320 and 176 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) modulated in response to salinity stress or inoculation x salinity stress, respectively. Notable results in plants under 8 dS/m stress included upregulation of a key gene involved in the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway with a concomitant decrease in expression of the SNrK pathway. Inoculation of salt-stressed plants stimulated increased transcription of a sulfate-uptake gene as well as upregulation of the Lysine-27-trimethyltransferase (EZH2), Histone 3 (H3), and argonaute (AGO, a component of miRISC silencing complexes) genes related to epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene control.

Soil rhizobia that form symbiosis with legumes may possess mechanisms to prevent heavy metal translocation from roots to shoots in plants by exporting metals from nodules or compartmentalizing metal ions inside nodules. Horizontal gene transfer has potential to confer immediate de novo adaptations to stress. We used comparative genomics of high quality de novo assemblies to identify structural differences in the genomes of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia that were isolated from a mercury (Hg) mine site that show high variation in their tolerance to Hg. Our analyses identified multiple structurally conserved merA homologs in the genomes of Sinorhizobium medicae and Rhizobium leguminosarum but only the strains that possessed a Mer operon exhibited 10-fold increased tolerance to Hg. RNAseq analysis revealed nearly all genes in the Mer operon were significantly up-regulated in response to Hg stress in free-living conditions and in nodules. In both free-living and nodule environments, we found the Hg-tolerant strains with a Mer operon exhibited the fewest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the genome, indicating a rapid and efficient detoxification of Hg from the cells that reduced general stress responses to the Hg-treatment. Expression changes in S. medicae while in bacteroids showed that both rhizobia strain and host-plant tolerance affected the number of DEGs. Aside from Mer operon genes, nif genes which are involved in nitrogenase activity in S. medicae showed significant up-regulation in the most Hg-tolerant strain while inside the most Hg-accumulating host-plant. Transfer of a plasmid containing the Mer operon from the most tolerant strain to low-tolerant strains resulted in an immediate increase in Hg tolerance, indicating that the Mer operon is able to confer hyper tolerance to Hg. Mer operons have not been previously reported in nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. This study demonstrates a pivotal role of the Mer operon in effective mercury detoxification and hypertolerance in nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. This finding has major implications not only for soil bioremediation, but also host plants growing in mercury contaminated soils.",38971740

Previous studies have indicated that the number of soybean nodules are increased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. However, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon remains elusive. In this study, transcriptome analysis was applied to identify candidate genes involved in regulating soybean nodulation mediated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Among the different expression genes (DEGs), we identified a gene encoding small heat shock protein (sHSP) called GmHSP23.9, which mainly expressed in soybean roots and nodules, and its expression was significantly induced by rhizobium USDA110 infection at 14days after inoculation (DAI) under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. We further investigated the role of GmHSP23.9 by generating transgenic composite plants carrying GmHSP23.9 overexpression (GmHSP23.9-OE), RNA interference (GmHSP23.9-RNAi), and CRISPR-Cas9 (GmHSP23.9-KO), and these modifications resulted in notable changes in nodule number and the root hairs deformation and suggesting that GmHSP23.9 function as an important positive regulator in soybean. Moreover, we found that altering the expression of GmHSP23.9 influenced the expression of genes involved in the Nod factor signaling pathway and AON signaling pathway to modulate soybean nodulation. Interestingly, we found that knocking down of GmHSP23.9 prevented the increase in the nodule number of soybean in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.

The compatible interaction between the host plant and rhizobia leads to the formation of root nodules, wherein internalization and transition of rhizobia into their symbiotic form, termed bacteroids, occur. Rhizobia in the nodules of the Inverted Repeat-Lacking Clade legumes, including Medicago truncatula, undergo terminal differentiation, resulting in elongated and endoreduplicated bacteroids. This transition of endocytosed rhizobia is mediated by a large gene family of host-produced nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides in M. truncatula. Few NCRs have been recently found to be essential for complete differentiation and persistence of bacteroids. Here, we show that a M. truncatula symbiotic mutant FN9285, defective in the complete transition of rhizobia, is deficient in a cluster of NCR genes. More specifically, we show that the loss of the duplicated genes NCR086 and NCR314 in the A17 genotype, found in a single copy in Medicago littoralis R108, is responsible for the ineffective symbiotic phenotype of FN9285. The NCR086 and NCR314 gene pair encodes the same mature peptide but their transcriptional activity varies considerably. Nevertheless, both genes can restore the effective symbiosis in FN9285 indicating that their complementation ability does not depend on the strength of their expression activity.

Under greenhouse conditions, foliar application of molecularly characterized Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strain 33504-Borg201 to the faba bean leaves 24 h before they were infected with BYMV made them much more resistant to the disease while also lowering its severity and accumulation. Furthermore, the treatment promoted plant growth and health, as evidenced by the increased total chlorophyll (32.75 mg/g f.wt.) and protein content (14.39 mg/g f.wt.), as well as the improved fresh and dry weights of the plants. The protective effects of 33504-Borg201 greatly lowered the levels of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (4.92 mol/g f.wt.) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (173.72 mol/g f.wt.).

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",The jasmonate pathway promotes nodule symbiosis and suppresses host plant defense in Medicago truncatula.,"Root nodule symbiosis (RNS) between legumes and rhizobia is a major source of nitrogen in agricultural systems. Effective symbiosis requires precise regulation of plant defense responses. The role of the defense hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in the immune response has been extensively studied. Current research shows that JA can play either a positive or negative regulatory role in RNS depending on its concentration, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that inoculation with the rhizobia Sm1021 induces the JA pathway in Medicago truncatula, and blocking the JA pathway significantly reduces the number of infection threads. Mutations in the MtMYC2 gene, which encodes a JA signaling master transcription factor, significantly inhibited rhizobia infection, terminal differentiation, and symbiotic cell formation. Combining RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we discovered that MtMYC2 regulates the expression of nodule-specific MtDNF2, MtNAD1, and MtSymCRK to suppress host defense, while it activates MtDNF1 expression to regulate the maturation of MtNCRs, which in turn promotes bacteroid formation. More importantly, MtMYC2 participates in symbiotic signal transduction by promoting the expression of MtIPD3. Notably, the MtMYC2-MtIPD3 transcriptional regulatory module is specifically present in legumes, and the Mtmyc2 mutants are susceptible to the infection by the pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.

After elicitation treatments, hairy roots were collected, and evaluated for growth index,total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) content, antioxidant activity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, DPPH and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power, FRAP assays), expression level of key phenolic/flavonoid biosynthesis genes, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of some main phenolic compounds in comparison to control. Elicitation positively or negatively affected the growth,content of phenolic/flavonoid compounds and DPPH and FRAP antioxidant activities of hairy roots cultures in depending of elicitor concentration and exposure time.

However, the symbionts associated with this plant in Mexico have not been studied. To investigate the diversity and species/symbiovar affiliations of rhizobia associated with faba bean in Mexico, rhizobia were isolated from this plant grown in two Mexican sites in the present study. Based upon the analysis of recA gene phylogeny, two genotypes were distinguished among a total of 35 isolates, and they were identified as Rhizobium hidalgonense and Rhizobium redzepovicii, respectively, by the whole genomic sequence analysis. Both the species harbored identical nod gene cluster and the same phylogenetic positions of nodC and nifH. So, all of them were identified into the symbiovar viciae. As a minor group, R. hidalgonense was only isolated from slightly acid soil and R. redzepovicii was the dominant group in both the acid and neutral soils. In addition, several genes related to resistance to metals (zinc, copper etc.) and metalloids (arsenic) were detected in genomes of the reference isolates, which might offer them some adaptation benefits.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Timely symbiosis: circadian control of legume-rhizobia symbiosis.,"Legumes house nitrogen-fixing endosymbiotic rhizobia in specialised polyploid cells within root nodules. This results in a mutualistic relationship whereby the plant host receives fixed nitrogen from the bacteria in exchange for dicarboxylic acids. This plant-microbe interaction requires the regulation of multiple metabolic and physiological processes in both the host and symbiont in order to achieve highly efficient symbiosis. Recent studies have showed that the success of symbiosis is influenced by the circadian clock of the plant host. Medicago and soybean plants with altered clock mechanisms showed compromised nodulation and reduced plant growth. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses revealed that multiple genes with key roles in recruitment of rhizobia to plant roots, infection and nodule development were under circadian control, suggesting that appropriate timing of expression of these genes may be important for nodulation. There is also evidence for rhythmic gene expression of key nitrogen fixation genes in the rhizobium symbiont, and temporal coordination between nitrogen fixation in the bacterial symbiont and nitrogen assimilation in the plant host may be important for successful symbiosis. Understanding of how circadian regulation impacts on nodule establishment and function will identify key plant-rhizobial connections and regulators that could be targeted to increase the efficiency of this relationship.",38779952

The results revealed that BH46 metabolized indole-3-acetic acid and induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase to decrease ethylene metabolism. Host peroxidase synthesis <i>MPK3/MPK6</i> genes were significantly downregulated, whereas eight genes associated with auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and antioxidant enzymes were significantly upregulated. Eight genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis were significantly upregulated, with the <i>CPY75B1</i> gene regulating the production of rutin and quercitrin and the <i>HCT</i> gene directly regulating the production of chlorogenic acid.

To the best of our knowledge, most of these research works resort to using only inorganic P (Pi) to the neglect of the organic P (Po) counterpart. As it stands, the potential regulating roles of plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases during legume-rhizobia symbiosis in response to phytic acid supply and how it alters and modulates the regulation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases remain obscure. To contribute to the above hypothesis, we investigate the mechanisms that coordinately facilitate the growth, uptake, and transcript expression of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene isoforms in response to different P sources when hydroponically grown Vicia faba plants were exposed to three P treatments, viz., low- and high-Pi (2.0 and 200 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; LPi and HPi), and phytic acid (200 M; Po) and inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 384 for 30 days. The results consistently reveal that the supply of Po improved not only the growth and biomass, but also enhanced photosynthetic parameters, P uptake and phosphatase activities in symbiotically grown Vicia faba relative to Pi. The supply of Po induced higher transcriptional expression of all PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene isoforms, with possible interactions between phosphatases and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase genes in Vicia faba plants when exclusively reliant on N derived from nodule symbiosis.

Herein, we identified a phosphatase, GmPP2C61A, which was specifically induced by rhizobia inoculation. Using transgenic hairy roots harboring GmPP2C61A::GUS, we showed that GmPP2C61A was mainly induced in epidermal cells following rhizobia inoculation. Functional analysis revealed that knockdown or knock-out of GmPP2C61A significantly reduced the number of nodules, while overexpression of GmPP2C61A promoted nodule formation. Additionally, GmPP2C61A protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and exhibited conserved phosphatase activity in vitro.

These microorganisms play a vital role in growth and development of the plant and also enhances the soil fertility by enriching the soil with different beneficial nutrients. This study was aimed at isolation of different rhizobacteria and their molecular characterization in search of efficient bacterial strains with multiple growth regulating activities. A total 36 bacteria were isolated from lentil root nodule as well as soil from different lentil growing fields with a view to screen/evaluate their plant growth promoting potential. Morphological characterization of isolated rhizobacterial candidates were done by observing the colonies on YEMA and nutrient agar media. Determination of CFU, Congo red test and gram staining tests were done to further screen them according to their morphology. All the isolates were then undergone molecular phylogenetic analysis using the partial sequences of the 16S rDNA. Based upon the Gram staining test, all the isolates were negative in gram reaction except six Bacillus isolates, PSB2 and AB3. Results of Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Nucleotide Sequences (BLASTn) from 16S rDNA gene sequences showed that these isolates are genetically diverse. A total of 15 isolates of Rhizobium, 6 isolates of Bacillus, 3 isolates of Pseudomonas, 2 isolates of Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria, 4 isolates of actinomycetes were identified by molecular sequencing of their 16S rDNA region and comparing them with the other isolates enlisted in the database of NCBI for the similarity percentage, query coverage.

Despite its primary role in sugar metabolism, GAPDH is recognized for its involvement in diverse cellular processes, being considered a paradigm among multifunctional/moonlighting proteins. Besides its canonical cytoplasmic location, GAPDH has been detected on cell surfaces or as a secreted protein in prokaryotes, yet little is known about its possible roles in plant symbiotic bacteria. Here we report that Rhizobium etli, a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of common beans, carries a single gap gene responsible for both GAPDH glycolytic and gluconeogenic activities. An active Gap protein is required throughout all stages of the symbiosis between R. etli and its host plant Phaseolus vulgaris. Both glycolytic and gluconeogenic Gap metabolic activities likely contribute to bacterial fitness during early and intermediate stages of the interaction, whereas GAPDH gluconeogenic activity seems critical for nodule invasion and nitrogen fixation. Although the R. etli Gap protein is secreted in a c-di-GMP related manner, no involvement of the R. etli gap gene in c-di-GMP related phenotypes, such as flocculation, biofilm formation or EPS production, was observed. Notably, the R. etli gap gene fully complemented a double gap1/gap2 mutant of Pseudomonas syringae for free life growth, albeit only partially in planta, suggesting potential specific roles for each type of Gap protein.

Here, we use random barcode transposon sequencing to assay gene contributions of R. leguminosarum during competitive growth in the rhizosphere and colonization of various plant species. This facilitated the identification of 189 genes commonly required for growth in diverse plant rhizospheres, mutation of 111 of which also affected subsequent root colonization (rhizosphere progressive), and a further 119 genes necessary for colonization. Common determinants reveal a need to synthesize essential compounds (amino acids, ribonucleotides, and cofactors), adapt metabolic function, respond to external stimuli, and withstand various stresses (such as changes in osmolarity). Additionally, chemotaxis and flagella-mediated motility are prerequisites for root colonization.

Here, we show that RinRK1 interacts with the extracellular domains of NF receptors (NFR1 and NFR5) to promote their accumulation at root hair tips in response to rhizobia or NFs. Furthermore, Flotillin 1 (Flot1), a nanodomain-organizing protein, associates with the kinase domains of NFR1, NFR5 and RinRK1. RinRK1 promotes the interactions between Flot1 and NF receptors and both RinRK1 and Flot1 are necessary for the accumulation of NF receptors at root hair tips upon NF stimulation.

We recently demonstrated that the phyllosphere (leaf surface) bacterial community structure changed when squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i>) was grown with a rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>) cover crop treatment, followed by a decrease of angular leaf spot disease symptoms on squash caused by <i>P. syringae</i> pv.<i>lachrymans</i>. Application of biocontrol agents is a known agricultural practice to mitigate crop losses due to microbial disease. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that some phyllosphere bacteria promoted when squash is grown on cover crops could be isolated and used as a biocontrol agent to decrease angular leaf spot symptoms. We grew squash during a 2-year field experiment using four agricultural practices: bare soil, cover crops, chemically terminated cover crops, and plastic cover. We sampled squash leaves at three different dates each year and constructed a collection of cultivable bacterial strains isolated from squash leaves and rye cover crop material.

Mature <i>P. cineraria</i> trees growing in the desert did not exhibit any detected root nodules. However, we observed root nodules on the roots of <i>P. cineraria</i> growing on a desert farm and on young plants growing in a growth chamber, when inoculated with rhizosphere soil, including with rhizosphere soil from near desert tree roots that had no nodules. Compared to nearby soil, non-nodulated roots were enriched with Actinobacteria (e.g., <i>Actinophytocola</i> sp.), whereas root nodules sampled from the desert farm and growth chamber had abundant Alphaproteobacteria (e.g., <i>Ensifer</i> sp.). These nodules yielded many microbes in addition to such nitrogen-fixing bacteria as <i>Ensifer</i> and <i>Sinorhizobium</i> species. Significant differences exist in the composition and abundance of microbial isolates between the nodule surface and the nodule endosphere. Shotgun metagenome analysis of nodule endospheres revealed that the root nodules comprised over 90% bacterial DNA, whereas metatranscriptome analysis showed that the plant produces vastly more transcripts than the microbes in these nodules. Control inoculations demonstrated that four out of six <i>Rhizobium, Agrobacterium,</i> or <i>Ensifer</i> isolates purified from <i>P. cineraria</i> nodules produced nodules in the roots of <i>P. cineraria</i> seedlings under greenhouse conditions.

Soil removed from regions near nodule-free roots on these mature plants contained an abundance of bacteria with the genetic ability to generate nodules and fix nitrogen but did not normally nodulate in their native rhizosphere environment, suggesting a very different co-evolved relationship than that observed for herbaceous legumes. The relative over-expression of the low-gene-density plant DNA compared to the bacterial DNA in the nodules was also unexpected, indicating a very powerful induction of host genetic contributions within the nodule.

While the presence of soil rhizobia is considered beneficial for plants, few studies have assessed whether variation in rhizobia abundance affects the tolerance of legumes to stressors. To address this, we assessed the effects of variable soil rhizobia inoculum concentrations on interactions between a legume host (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), a vector insect (<i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i>), and a virus (<i>Pea enation mosaic virus</i>, PEMV). We showed that increased rhizobia abundance reduces the inhibitory effects of PEMV on the nodule formation and root growth in 2-week-old plants. However, these trends were reversed in 4-week-old plants. Rhizobia abundance did not affect shoot growth or virus prevalence in 2- or 4-week-old plants. Our results show that rhizobia abundance may indirectly affect legume tolerance to a virus, but effects varied based on plant age. To assess the mechanisms that mediated interactions between rhizobia, plants, aphids, and PEMV, we measured the relative expression of gene transcripts related to plant defense signaling. Rhizobia concentrations did not strongly affect the expression of defense genes associated with phytohormone signaling. Our study shows that an abundance of soil rhizobia may impact a plant's ability to tolerate stressors such as vector-borne pathogens, as well as aid in developing sustainable pest and pathogen management systems for legume crops.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",The evolutionary genomics of adaptation to stress in wild rhizobium bacteria.,"Microbiota comprise the bulk of life's diversity, yet we know little about how populations of microbes accumulate adaptive diversity across natural landscapes. Adaptation to stressful soil conditions in plants provides seminal examples of adaptation in response to natural selection via allelic substitution. For microbes symbiotic with plants however, horizontal gene transfer allows for adaptation via gene gain and loss, which could generate fundamentally different evolutionary dynamics. We use comparative genomics and genetics to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation to physiologically stressful serpentine soils in rhizobial bacteria in western North American grasslands. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the presence of a locus of major effect, the <i>nre</i> operon, is necessary and sufficient to confer adaptation to nickel, a heavy metal enriched to toxic levels in serpentine soil, and a major axis of environmental soil chemistry variation. We find discordance between inferred evolutionary histories of the core genome and <i>nreAXY</i> genes, which often reside in putative genomic islands. This suggests that the evolutionary history of this adaptive variant is marked by frequent losses, and/or gains via horizontal acquisition across divergent rhizobium clades. However, different <i>nre</i> alleles confer distinct levels of nickel resistance, suggesting allelic substitution could also play a role in rhizobium adaptation to serpentine soil. These results illustrate that the interplay between evolution via gene gain and loss and evolution via allelic substitution may underlie adaptation in wild soil microbiota. Both processes are important to consider for understanding adaptive diversity in microbes and improving stress-adapted microbial inocula for human use.",38507447

To date, no comparative analysis of the symbiotic properties and heterogeneity of T. pratense microsymbionts derived from two distinct geographic regions has been performed. In this study, the symbiotic properties of strains originating from the subpolar and temperate climate zones in a wide range of temperatures (10-25C) have been characterized. Our results indicate that all the studied T. pratense microsymbionts from two geographic regions were highly efficient in host plant nodulation and nitrogen fixation in a wide range of temperatures. However, some differences between the populations and between the strains within the individual population examined were observed. Based on the nodC and nifH sequences, the symbiotic diversity of the strains was estimated. In general, 13 alleles for nodC and for nifH were identified. Moreover, 21 and 61 polymorphic sites in the nodC and nifH sequences were found, respectively, indicating that the latter gene shows higher heterogeneity than the former one. Among the nodC and nifH alleles, three genotypes (I-III) were the most frequent, whereas the other alleles (IV-XIII) proved to be unique for the individual strains. Based on the nodC and nifH allele types, 20 nodC-nifH genotypes were identified. Among them, the most frequent were three genotypes marked as A (6 strains), B (5 strains), and C (3 strains). Type A was exclusively found in the temperate strains, whereas types B and C were identified in the subpolar strains. The remaining 17 genotypes were found in single strains. In conclusion, our data indicate that R. leguminosarum sv. trifolii strains derived from two climatic zones show a high diversity with respect to the symbiotic efficiency and heterogeneity. However, some of the R. leguminosarum sv. trifolii strains exhibit very good symbiotic potential in the wide range of the temperatures tested; hence, they may be used in the future for improvement of legume crop production.",38491088

When unrepaired, death quickly ensues. In most bacterial systems, DSBs are repaired through homologous recombination. Nearly one-quarter of bacterial species harbor a second system, allowing direct ligation of broken ends, known as Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). The relative role of both systems in DSBs repair in bacteria has been explored only in a few cases. To evaluate this in the bacterium <i>Rhizobium etli</i>, we used a modified version of the symbiotic plasmid (264kb), containing a single copy of the <i>nifH</i> gene. In this plasmid, we inserted an integrative plasmid harboring a modified <i>nifH</i> gene fragment containing an I-SceI site. DSBs were easily inflicted <i>in vivo</i> by conjugating a small, replicative plasmid that expresses the I-SceI nuclease into the appropriate strains. Repair of a DSB may be achieved through homologous recombination (either between adjacent or distant repeats) or NHEJ. Characterization of the derivatives that repaired DSB in different configurations, revealed that in most cases (74%), homologous recombination was the prevalent mechanism responsible for repair, with a relatively minor contribution of NHEJ (23%). Inactivation of the I-SceI gene was detected in 3% of the cases. Sequence analysis of repaired derivatives showed the operation of NHEJ. To enhance the number of derivatives repaired through NHEJ, we repeated these experiments in a <i>recA</i> mutant background. Derivatives showing NHEJ were readily obtained when the DSB occurred on a small, artificial plasmid in a <i>recA</i> mutant. However, attempts to deliver a DSB on the symbiotic plasmid in a <i>recA</i> background failed, due to the accumulation of mutations that inactivated the I-SceI gene. This result, coupled with the absence of derivatives that lost the nonessential symbiotic plasmid, may be due to an unusual stability of the symbiotic plasmid, possibly caused by the presence of multiple toxin-antitoxin modules.",38481790

In this study, we identify an important player in this intricate interplay: Lotus japonicus PRP1, which serves as a positive regulator of plant immunity but also exhibits the capacity to decrease rhizobial colonization and nitrogen fixation within nodules. The PRP1 gene encodes an uncharacterized protein and is named Pathogenesis-Related Protein1, owing to its orthologue in Arabidopsis thaliana, a pathogenesis-related family protein (At1g78780). The PRP1 gene displays high expression levels in nodules compared to other tissues. We observed an increase in rhizobium infection in the L. japonicus prp1 mutants, whereas PRP1-overexpressing plants exhibited a reduction in rhizobium infection compared to control plants. Intriguingly, L. japonicus prp1 mutants produced nodules with a pinker colour compared to wild-type controls, accompanied by elevated levels of leghaemoglobin and an increased proportion of infected cells within the prp1 nodules. The transcription factor Nodule Inception (NIN) can directly bind to the PRP1 promoter, activating PRP1 gene expression. Furthermore, we found that PRP1 is a positive mediator of innate immunity in plants. In summary, our study provides clear evidence of the intricate relationship between plant immunity and symbiosis.

In this study, we characterized the structural features of T-DNA that induce TGS during agroinfiltration. When <i>A. tumefaciens</i> cells harboring an empty T-DNA plasmid containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were infiltrated into the leaves of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> line 16c with a GFP gene over-expressed under the control of the same promoter, no small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were derived from the GFP sequence. However, siRNAs derived from the CaMV 35S promoter were detected, indicating that TGS against the GFP gene was induced. When the GFP gene was inserted into the T-DNA plasmid, PTGS against the GFP gene was induced whereas TGS against the CaMV 35S promoter was suppressed. We also showed the importance of terminator sequences in T-DNA for gene silencing. Therefore, depending on the combination of promoter, terminator and coding sequences on T-DNA and the host nuclear genome, either or both TGS and/or PTGS could be induced by agroinfiltration. Furthermore, we showed the possible involvement of three siRNA-producing Dicers (DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4) in the induction of TGS by the co-agroinfiltration method.

Interestingly, these AAT genes were not evenly distributed across the chromosomes of P. vulgaris . Instead, there was an unusual concentration of these genes located toward the outer edges of chromosomal arms. Upon conducting motif analysis and gene structural analysis, we observed a consistent presence of similar motifs and an intron-exon distribution pattern among the subfamilies. When we analyzed the expression profiles of PvAAT genes, we noted tissue-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, our investigation into AAT gene expression under rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiotic conditions revealed that certain genes exhibited high levels of expression. Specifically, ATLa5 and LHT2 was notably upregulated under both symbiotic conditions. These findings point towards a potential role of AATs in the context of rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis in P. vulgaris, in addition to their well-established regulatory functions.",38430379

The effects of two explant types (i.e., leaf and stem from the in vitro seedlings of three genotypes of Withania somnifera) and four Rhizobium strains (i.e., LBA 9402, A4, ATCC 15834, and C58C1) to improve hairy root formation efficiency was studied. Furthermore, the combined effects of -cyclodextrin (-CD) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on withaferin A production after 48h exposure time was examined. Four hairy roots having the maximum percentage of induced roots and mean number of induced roots to analyze their growth kinetics and identified G3/ATCC/LEAF culture having the maximum specific growth rate (= 0.036 day<sup>-1</sup>) and growth index (GI=9.18), and the shortest doubling time (T<sub>d</sub>=18.82 day) were selected. After 48h exposure of G3/ATCC/LEAF culture to different elicitation conditions, maximum amounts of withaferin A were produced in samples co-treated with 0.5mM -CD + 100M MeJA (9.57mg/g DW) and 5.0mM -CD+100M MeJA (17.45mg/g DW). These outcomes represented a 6.8-fold and 12.5-fold increase, respectively, compared to the control. Similarly, combined -CD/MeJA elicitation increased gene expression levels of HMGR, SQS, SMT-1, and SDS/CYP710A involved in withanolides biosynthetic pathway, of which just SMT-1 had significant correlation with withaferin A production. These results demonstrated the superiority of G1-leaf explant and ATCC 15834 for hairy root induction, and revealed synergistic effect of MeJA and -CD on withaferin A production.",38412705

Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is an economically important crop worldwide, but the functional validation of soybean chitinase in defense responses remains limited. In this study, genome-wide characterization of soybean chitinases was conducted, and the defense contribution of three chitinases (GmChi01, GmChi02, or GmChi16) was validated in <i>Arabidopsis</i> transgenic lines against the soil-borne pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. Compared to the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Col-0 and empty vector controls, the transgenic lines with GmChi02 or GmChi16 exhibited fewer chlorosis symptoms and wilting. While GmChi02 and GmChi16 enhanced defense to <i>F. oxysporum</i>, GmChi02 was the only one significantly induced by <i>Burkholderia ambifaria</i>. The observation indicated that plant chitinases may be induced by different rhizobacteria for defense responses. The survey of 37 soybean chitinase gene expressions in response to six rhizobacteria observed diverse inducibility, where only 10 genes were significantly upregulated by at least one rhizobacterium and 9 genes did not respond to any of the rhizobacteria. Motif analysis on soybean promoters further identified not only consensus but also rhizobacterium-specific transcription factor-binding sites for the inducible chitinase genes. Collectively, these results confirmed the involvement of GmChi02 and GmChi16 in defense enhancement and highlighted the diverse inducibility of 37 soybean chitinases encountering <i>F. oxysporum</i> and six rhizobacteria.",38405589

Since its initial publication, the original protocol has been extensively modified, but these modifications have not been adequately or systematically reported, making it difficult to assess the reproducibility of the method. The protocol presented here is an update and expansion of the original method. Importantly, it includes new, critical steps for generating transgenic hairy roots and using them in molecular analyses based on reverse-genetics approaches. Using this protocol, the expression of two different genes, used as an example, was significantly increased or decreased in approximately 30% of the transformed plants. In addition, the promoter activity of a given gene was observed, and the infection process of rhizobia in transgenic hairy roots was monitored successfully.

In the past two decades, research has extensively explored the rhizobial diversity associated with chickpea and its breeding in various countries across Europe, Asia, and Oceania, aiming to understand its impact on the sustainable yield and quality of chickpea crops. To date, four notable species of <i>Mesorhizobium</i>-<i>M. ciceri</i>, <i>M. mediterraneum</i>, <i>M. muleiense</i>, and <i>M. wenxiniae</i>-have been reported, originally isolated from chickpea root nodules.

The geographic distribution of chickpea rhizobia is believed to be influenced by factors such as genetic characteristics, competitiveness, evolutionary adaptation to local soil conditions, and compatibility with native soil microbes. Inoculating chickpea with suitable rhizobial strains is crucial when introducing the crop to new regions lacking indigenous chickpea rhizobia. The introduction of a novel chickpea variety, coupled with the effective use of rhizobia for inoculation, offers the potential not only to boost the yield and seed quality of chickpeas, but also to enhance crop productivity within rotation and intercropped systems involving chickpea and other crops.

Thus, we aim to elucidate the diversity, structure, and function of the bacterial community of 30-day storage potato scabby tubers stored in different temperatures using 16S amplicon metagenomic sequencing. Bacterial communities of storage potato scabby tubers (Spuntacultivar) collected from different storage temperatures, 4C (MEP1) and 6C (MEP2), were characterized using 16S rRNAamplicon metagenomic sequencing. The alpha-diversity abundance in the bacteriome of the scabby tubers stored at 6 C was higher than in those stored at 4 C. Actinobacteria (34.7%) was a dominant phylum in MEP1, while Proteobacteria (39.9%) was predominant in MEP2. The top 10 genera of both communities were Rhizobium group, Streptomyces, Pectobacterium, Ruminococcus, Cellulomonas, Promicromonospora, Prevotella, Enterobacter, Pedobacter, and Paenarthrobacter. Moreover, functional profile prediction of both communities reveals essential genes in the pathosystem: nos, bglA, and cebEFG-msiK for potato scab disease and phc and peh operons for rot disease.

Concentrations of phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), and sulfur (S) with V are negatively correlated in the shoots of wild-type R108, but not in mutant nsp1 and nsp2 shoots. Mutations in the P transporter PHT1, PHO1, and VPT families, Fe transporter IRT1, and S transporter SULTR1/3/4 family confer varying degrees of V tolerance on plants. Among these gene families, MtPT1, MtZIP6, MtZIP9, and MtSULTR1; 1 in R108 roots are significantly inhibited by V stress, while MtPHO1; 2, MtVPT2, and MtVPT3 are significantly induced. Overexpression of Arabidopsis thaliana VPT1 or M. truncatula MtVPT3 increases plant V tolerance. However, the response of these genes to V is weakened in nsp1 or nsp2 and influenced by soil microorganisms. Mutations in NSPs reduce rhizobacterial diversity under V stress and simplify the V-responsive operational taxonomic unit modules in co-occurrence networks. Furthermore, R108 recruits more beneficial rhizobacteria related to V, P, Fe, and S than does nsp1 or nsp2.

High-throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial community and quantitative PCR analysis of nitrogen cycling genes show that ciprofloxacin and tetracycline significantly shift bacterial community structure in bulk soil, whereas plant host may mitigate the disturbances of antibiotics on bacterial communities in root-associated niches (i.e., rhizosphere and rhizoplane) through the community stabilization. Deterministic assembly, microbial interaction, and keystone species (e.g., Rhizobium and Massilia) of root-associated bacterial communities benefit the community stability compared with those in bulk soil. Meanwhile, the rhizosphere increases antibiotic dissipation, potentially reducing the impacts of antibiotics on root-associated bacterial communities. Furthermore, rhizospheric effects deriving from root exudates alleviate the impacts of antibiotics on the nitrogen cycle (i.e., nitrification, organic nitrogen conversion and denitrification) as confirmed by functional gene quantification, which is largely attributed to the bacterial community stability in rhizosphere.

The four isolates were found to have the <i>nifH</i> gene, and the study confirmed that one isolate (GM5) had both the <i>nifH</i> and <i>nodC</i> genes. The Salkowski method was used to measure the isolated bacteria for their capacity to produce phytohormone indole acetic acid (IAA). Additional experiments were performed to examine the effect of the isolated bacteria on root morphology and nodulation. Among the four tested isolates, both WC24 and GM5 induced nodulation in <i>Glycine max</i>. The gene expression studies revealed that GM5 had a higher expression of the <i>nifH</i> gene. The existence and expression of the nitrogen-fixing genes implied that the tested strain had the ability to fix the atmospheric nitrogen.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Molecular module GmPTF1a/b-GmNPLa regulates rhizobia infection and nodule formation in soybean.,"Nodulation begins with the initiation of infection threads (ITs) in root hairs. Though mutual recognition and early symbiotic signaling cascades in legumes are well understood, molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial infection processes and successive nodule organogenesis remain largely unexplored. We functionally investigated a novel pectate lyase enzyme, GmNPLa, and its transcriptional regulator GmPTF1a/b in soybean (Glycine max), where their regulatory roles in IT development and nodule formation were elucidated through investigation of gene expression patterns, bioinformatics analysis, biochemical verification of genetic interactions, and observation of phenotypic impacts in transgenic soybean plants. GmNPLa was specifically induced by rhizobium inoculation in root hairs. Manipulation of GmNPLa produced remarkable effects on IT and nodule formation. GmPTF1a/b displayed similar expression patterns as GmNPLa, and manipulation of GmPTF1a/b also severely influenced nodulation traits. LI soybeans with low nodulation phenotypes were nearly restored to HI nodulation level by complementation of GmNPLa and/or GmPTF1a. Further genetic and biochemical analysis demonstrated that GmPTF1a can bind to the E-box motif to activate transcription of GmNPLa, and thereby facilitate nodulation. Taken together, our findings potentially reveal novel mediation of cell wall gene expression involving the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor GmPTF1a/b acts as a key early regulator of nodulation in soybean.",38062896
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Role of a LORELEI- like gene from Phaseolus vulgaris during a mutualistic interaction with Rhizobium tropici.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by NADPH oxidases known as RBOHs in plants, play a key role in plant development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, hormone signaling, and reproduction. Among the subfamily of receptor-like kinases referred to as CrRLK, there is FERONIA (FER), a regulator of RBOHs, and FER requires a GPI-modified membrane protein produced by LORELEI (LRE) or LORELEI-like proteins (LLG) to reach the plasma membrane and generate ROS. In Arabidopsis, AtLLG1 is involved in interactions with microbes as AtLLG1 interacts with the flagellin receptor (FLS2) to trigger the innate immune response, but the role of LLGs in mutualistic interactions has not been examined. In this study, two Phaseolus vulgaris LLG genes were identified, PvLLG2 that was expressed in floral tissue and PvLLG1 that was expressed in vegetative tissue. Transcripts of PvLLG1 increased during rhizobial nodule formation peaking during the early period of well-developed nodules. Also, P. vulgaris roots expressing pPvLLG1:GFP-GUS showed that this promoter was highly active during rhizobium infections, and very similar to the subcellular localization using a construct pLLG1::PvLLG1-Neon. Compared to control plants, PvLLG1 silenced plants had less superoxide (O2-) at the root tip and elongation zone, spotty hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the elongation root zone, and significantly reduced root hair length, nodule number and nitrogen fixation. Unlike control plants, PvLLG1 overexpressing plants showed superoxide beyond the nodule meristem, and significantly increased nodule number and nodule diameter. PvLLG1 appears to play a key role during this mutualistic interaction, possibly due to the regulation of the production and distribution of ROS in roots.",38060483

Their role extends beyond the leguminous species, as numerous nodulin-like proteins, including early nodulin-like proteins (ENODL), have been identified in various non-leguminous plants, implying their involvement in functions beyond nodulation, such as nutrient transport and growth modulation. Some ENODL proteins have been associated with plant defense against pathogens, as evident in banana infected with Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) causing banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) disease. Nonetheless, the specific role of ENODL in plant defense remains to be fully elucidated. The MusaENODL3 gene was found to be repressed in BXW-resistant banana progenitor 'Musa balbisiana' and 20-fold upregulated in BXW-susceptible cultivar 'Gonja Manjaya' upon early infection with Xcm. To further unravel the role of the ENODL gene in disease resistance, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was employed to disrupt the MusaENODL3 gene in 'Gonja Manjaya' precisely. Analysis of the enodl3 edited events confirmed the accurate manipulation of the MusaENODL3 gene. Disease resistance and gene expression analysis demonstrated that editing the MusaENODL3 gene resulted in resistance to BXW disease, with 50% of the edited plants remaining asymptomatic. The identification and manipulation of the MusaENODL3 gene highlight its potential as a critical player in plant-pathogen interactions, offering new opportunities for enhancing disease resistance in crops like banana, an important staple food crop and source of income for resource-poor farmers in the tropics. This study provides the first evidence of the direct role of the ENODL3 gene in developing disease-resistant plants.",38013635

However, a lot of plant species are known to contain such sequences, called cellular T-DNAs (cT-DNAs), and maintain normal phenotypes. Some of the genes remain intact, which leads to the conclusion of their functional role in plants. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cT-DNAs in the <i>Nicotiana noctiflora</i> Hook. genome, including gene expression and opine identification. Deep sequencing of the <i>Nicotiana noctiflora</i> genome revealed the presence of two different <i>c</i>T-DNAs, <i>Nn</i>T-DNA1 and <i>Nn</i>T-DNA2, which contain the intact genes <i>iaaM</i>, <i>iaaH</i>, <i>acs</i>, <i>orf13</i>, <i>orf13a</i>, and <i>orf14</i>.

The LURP-one related (LOR) protein family plays a pivotal role in mediating plant defense responses against both biotic and abiotic stresses. However, our understanding of its function in the symbiotic interaction between legumes and rhizobia remains limited. Here, Rpf107, a homolog of LOR, was identified in Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust). The subcellular localization of Rpf107 was analyzed, and its function was investigated using RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression techniques. The subcellular localization assay revealed that Rpf107 was mainly distributed in the plasma membrane and nucleus. Rpf107 silencing prevented rhizobial infection and hampered plant growth. The number of infected cells in the nitrogen fixation zone of the Rpf107-RNAi nodules was also noticeably lower than that in the control nodules. Notably, Rpf107 silencing resulted in bacteroid degradation and the premature aging of nodules. In contrast, the overexpression of Rpf107 delayed the senescence of nodules and prolonged the nitrogen-fixing ability of nodules. These results demonstrate that Rpf107 was involved in the infection of rhizobia and the maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in black locust root nodules. The findings reveal that a member of the LOR protein family plays a role in leguminous root nodule symbiosis, which is helpful to clarify the functions of plant LOR protein family and fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying legume-rhizobium symbiosis.",38001306
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",A rare non-canonical splice site in Trema orientalis SYMRK does not affect its dual symbiotic functioning in endomycorrhiza and rhizobium nodulation.,"Nitrogen-fixing nodules occur in ten related taxonomic lineages interspersed with lineages of non-nodulating plant species. Nodules result from an endosymbiosis between plants and diazotrophic bacteria; rhizobia in the case of legumes and Parasponia and Frankia in the case of actinorhizal species. Nodulating plants share a conserved set of symbiosis genes, whereas related non-nodulating sister species show pseudogenization of several key nodulation-specific genes. Signalling and cellular mechanisms critical for nodulation have been co-opted from the more ancient plant-fungal arbuscular endomycorrhizal symbiosis. Studies in legumes and actinorhizal plants uncovered a key component in symbiotic signalling, the LRR-type SYMBIOSIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SYMRK). SYMRK is essential for nodulation and arbuscular endomycorrhizal symbiosis. To our surprise, however, despite its arbuscular endomycorrhizal symbiosis capacities, we observed a seemingly critical mutation in a donor splice site in the SYMRK gene of Trema orientalis, the non-nodulating sister species of Parasponia. This led us to investigate the symbiotic functioning of SYMRK in the Trema-Parasponia lineage and to address the question of to what extent a single nucleotide polymorphism in a donor splice site affects the symbiotic functioning of SYMRK. We show that SYMRK is essential for nodulation and endomycorrhization in Parasponia andersonii. Subsequently, it is revealed that the 5'-intron donor splice site of SYMRK intron 12 is variable and, in most dicotyledon species, doesn't contain the canonical dinucleotide 'GT' signature but the much less common motif 'GC'. Strikingly, in T. orientalis, this motif is converted into a rare non-canonical 5'-intron donor splice site 'GA'. This SYMRK allele, however, is fully functional and spreads in the T. orientalis population of Malaysian Borneo. A further investigation into the occurrence of the non-canonical GA-AG splice sites confirmed that these are extremely rare. SYMRK functioning is highly conserved in legumes, actinorhizal plants, and Parasponia. The gene possesses a non-common 5'-intron GC donor splice site in intron 12, which is converted into a GA in T. orientalis accessions of Malaysian Borneo.

Previously established hairy root lines of <i>C. asiatica</i> were categorized based on their centelloside production capacity into HIGH, MID, or LOW groups. These lines were then subjected to a meticulous label-free proteomic analysis to identify and quantify proteins. Subsequent multivariate and protein network analyses were conducted to discern proteome differences and commonalities. Additionally, the quantification of rol gene copy numbers was undertaken using qPCR, followed by gene expression measurements. From the proteomic analysis, 213 proteins were identified. Distinct proteome differences, especially between the LOW line and other lines, were observed. Key proteins related to essential processes like photosynthesis and specialized metabolism were identified. Notably, potential biomarkers, such as the Tr-type G domain-containing protein and alcohol dehydrogenase, were found in the HIGH group. The presence of ornithine cyclodeaminase in the hairy roots emerged as a significant biomarker linked with centelloside production capacity lines, indicating successful <i>Rhizobium</i>-mediated genetic transformation.

In this study, the degradation characteristics of atrazine was investigated in ten different soil types. Further, diversity and abundance of degradation genes and succession of the bacterial community were also studied. The degradation of 10mg/kg atrazine in different soil types exhibited an initial rapid trend followed by a gradual slowdown, adhering to the first-order kinetic equation. Atrazine significantly increased the absolute abundance of atz degradation genes. The increase in the absolute abundance of atzC gene was the largest, whereas that of atzA gene was the smallest, and the trzD gene was only detected in the Binzhou loam soil. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the number of potential bacterial hosts of atzC was the highest compared with the other atz genes. Atrazine also altered the structural composition of the soil microbial community. The relative abundances of Ochrobactrum, Nocardiopsis, Lactobacillus, and Brevibacterium was increased in the atrazine-treated soils, while those of Conexibate, Solirubacter, and Micromonospora was decreased significantly compared with the control. Additionally, four atrazine-degrading bacterial strains Rhizobium AT1, Stenotrophomonas AT2, Brevibacterium AT3, and Bacillus AT4 were isolated from the atrazine-treated soils. After 14 d for inoculation, their degradation rate for 10mg/L atrazine ranged from 17.56% to 30.55%. Moreover, the relative abundances of the bacterial genera, including these four isolates, in the atrazine-treated soil were significantly higher than those in the control, indicating that they were involved in the synergistic degradation of atrazine in the soil.

Although CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing with its high efficiency and specificity, the performance of the system can be affected by multiple factors, such as sgRNA specificity and effectiveness, and the choice of promoter used to drive Cas9 expression. The use of a hairy root transformation system to initially check the efficiency of sgRNAs and the impact of different promoters could speed up this process and increase the chances of success. We initially tested three different transformation methods to induce hairy roots and selected a preferred method suitable for a variety of different common bean genotypes. This method involved inoculating a severed radicle with <i>Rhizobium rhizogenes</i> K599 and was fast, had a high transformation frequency of 42-48%, and resulted in numerous hairy roots. This method was further used for the transformation of explants using <i>R. rhizogenes</i> harboring different CRISPR/Cas9 constructs and evaluated the on-target activity of sgRNAs targeting raffinose family oligosaccharides biosynthetic genes and the impact of different promoters driving Cas9 on the gene editing efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the reliability of the <i>in silico</i> tools, CRISPOR, CRISPR RGEN, and inDelphi to predict the sgRNA efficiencies and resulting mutations. Our results showed that the hairy root transformation system allows for rapid evaluation of multiple sgRNAs and promoters. We also identified several highly efficient sgRNAs that induced frameshift mutations at rates of up to 70% when a parsley ubiquitin promoter was driving Cas9 expression, providing valuable information for the selection of the most effective sgRNAs and promoters for future transformation experiments. Although most of the computational models used to predict the sgRNA efficiency did not match the <i>in planta</i> results, the Lindel model proved to be the most reliable for <i>P. vulgaris</i>, accurately predicting the sgRNA efficiency and the type of induced mutation in most hairy roots.

The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition mechanisms of tetracycline in relation to soybean growth and ecological networks in the roots and rhizosphere. To this end, we conducted a pot experiment in which soybean seedlings were grown in soil treated with 0, 10, or 25mg/kg tetracycline. The effects of tetracycline pollution on growth, productivity, oxidative stress, and nitrogenase activity were evaluated. We further identified the changes in microbial taxa composition and structure at the genus and species levels by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene region. The results showed that tetracycline activates the antioxidant defense system in soybeans, which reduces the abundance of Bradyrhizobiaceae, inhibits the nitrogen-fixing ability, and decreases the nitrogen content in the root system. Tetracycline was also found to suppress the formation of the rhizospheric environment and decrease the complexity and stability of bacterial networks. Beta diversity analysis showed that the community structure of the root was markedly changed by the addition of tetracycline, which predominantly affected stochastic processes. These findings demonstrate that the influence of tetracycline on soybean roots could be attributed to the decreased stability of the bacterial community structure, which limits the number of rhizobium nodules and inhibits the nitrogen-fixing capacity. This exploration of the inhibitory mechanisms of tetracycline in relation to soybean root development emphasises the potential risks of tetracycline pollution to plant growth in an agricultural setting.

Successful infection requires complex coordination between compatible host and endosymbiont, including bacterial production of succinoglycan, also known as exopolysaccharide-I (EPS-I). In S. meliloti EPS-I production is controlled by the conserved ExoS-ChvI two-component system. Periplasmic ExoR associates with the ExoS histidine kinase and negatively regulates ChvI-dependent expression of exo genes, necessary for EPS-I synthesis. We show that two extracytoplasmic proteins, LppA (a lipoprotein) and JspA (a lipoprotein and a metalloprotease), jointly influence EPS-I synthesis by modulating the ExoR-ExoS-ChvI pathway and expression of genes in the ChvI regulon. Deletions of jspA and lppA led to lower EPS-I production and competitive disadvantage during host colonization, for both S. meliloti with Medicago sativa and S. medicae with M. truncatula. Overexpression of jspA reduced steady-state levels of ExoR, suggesting that the JspA protease participates in ExoR degradation. This reduction in ExoR levels is dependent on LppA and can be replicated with ExoR, JspA, and LppA expressed exogenously in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli.

"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Unveiling the regulatory mechanisms of salicylate degradation gene cluster <i>cehGHIR4</i> in <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. strain X9.,"In a previous study, the novel gene cluster <i>cehGHI</i> was found to be involved in salicylate degradation through the CoA-mediated pathway in <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. strain X9 (Mol Microbiol 116:783-793, 2021). In this study, an IclR family transcriptional regulator CehR4 was identified. In contrast to other regulators involved in salicylate degradation, <i>cehR4</i> forms one operon with the gentisyl-CoA thioesterase gene <i>cehI</i>, while <i>cehG</i> and <i>cehH</i> (encoding salicylyl-CoA ligase and salicylyl-CoA hydroxylase, respectively) form another operon. <i>cehGH</i> and <i>cehIR4</i> are divergently transcribed, and their promoters overlap. The results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting showed that CehR4 binds to the 42-bp motif between genes <i>cehH</i> and <i>cehI</i>, thus regulating transcription of <i>cehGH</i> and <i>cehIR4</i>. The repeat sequences IR1 (5'-TTTATATAAA-3') and IR2 (5'-AATATAGAAA-3') in the motif are key sites for CehR4 binding. The arrangement of <i>cehGH</i> and <i>cehIR4</i> and the conserved binding motif of CehR4 were also found in other bacterial genera. The results disclose the regulatory mechanism of salicylate degradation through the CoA pathway and expand knowledge about the systems controlled by IclR family transcriptional regulators.IMPORTANCEThe long-term residue of aromatic compounds in the environment has brought great threat to the environment and human health. Microbial degradation plays an important role in the elimination of aromatic compounds in the environment. Salicylate is a common intermediate metabolite in the degradation of various aromatic compounds. Recently, <i>Rhizobium</i> sp. strain X9, capable of degrading the pesticide carbaryl, was isolated from carbaryl-contaminated soil. Salicylate is the intermediate metabolite that appeared during the degradation of carbaryl, and a novel salicylate degradation pathway and the involved gene cluster <i>cehGHIR4</i> have been identified. This study identified and characterized the IclR transcription regulator CehR4 that represses transcription of <i>cehGHIR4</i> gene cluster. Additionally, the genetic arrangements of <i>cehGH</i> and <i>cehIR4</i> and the binding sites of <i>CehR4</i> were also found in other bacterial genera. This study provides insights into the biodegradation of salicylate and provides an application in the bioremediation of aromatic compound-contaminated environments.",37800922

However, age-related changes in oral health are not well understood due to challenges with current animal models. In this study, we analyzed the oral health and microbiota of a short-lived non-human primate (i.e., marmoset), as a step towards establishing a surrogate for studying the changes that occur in oral health during human aging. We investigated the oral health of marmosets using cadaveric tissues in three different cohorts: young (aged 6 years), middle-aged, and older (>10 years) and assessed the gingival bacterial community using analyses of the V3-V4 variable region of 16S rRNA gene. The oldest cohort had a significantly higher number of dental caries, increased dental attrition/erosion, and deeper periodontal pocket depth scores. Oral microbiome analyses showed that older marmosets had a significantly greater abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Propionibacterium, and a lower abundance of Agrobacterium/Rhizobium at the genus level. Alpha diversity of the microbiome between the three groups showed no significant differences; however, principal coordinate analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples from middle-aged and older marmosets were more closely clustered than the youngest cohort. In addition, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEFSe) identified a higher abundance of Esherichia-Shigella as a potential pathogenic biomarker in older animals. Our findings confirm that changes in the oral microbiome are associated with a decline in oral health in aging marmosets. The current study suggests that the marmoset model recapitulates some of the changes in oral health associated with human aging and may provide opportunities for developing new preventive strategies or interventions which target these disease conditions.",37775702
"""Rhizobium"" AND ""gene""",Overexpression of BAPT and DBTNBT genes in Taxus baccatain vitro cultures to enhance the biotechnological production of paclitaxel.,"Paclitaxel is one of the most effective anticancer drugs ever developed. Although the most sustainable approach to its production is provided by plant cell cultures, the yield is limited by bottleneck enzymes in the taxane biosynthetic pathway: baccatin-aminophenylpropanoyl-13-O-transferase (BAPT) and 3'-N-debenzoyltaxol N-benzoyltransferase (DBTNBT). With the aim of enhancing paclitaxel production by overcoming this bottleneck, we obtained distinct lines of Taxus baccata in vitro roots, each independently overexpressing either of the two flux-limiting genes, BAPT or DBTNBT, through a Rhizobium rhizogenes A4-mediated transformation. Due to the slow growth rate of the transgenic Taxus roots, they were dedifferentiated to obtain callus lines and establish cell suspensions. The transgenic cells were cultured in a two-stage system and stimulated for taxane production by a dual elicitation treatment with 1m coronatine plus 50mm of randomly methylated--cyclodextrins. A high overexpression of BAPT (59.72-fold higher at 48h) and DBTNBT (61.93-fold higher at 72h) genes was observed in the transgenic cell cultures, as well as an improved taxane production. Compared to the wild type line (71.01mg/L), the DBTNBT line produced more than four times higher amounts of paclitaxel (310mg/L), while the content of this taxane was almost doubled in the BAPT line (135mg/L). A transcriptional profiling of taxane biosynthetic genes revealed that GGPPS, TXS and DBAT genes were the most reactive to DBTNBT overexpression and the dual elicitation, their expression increasing gradually and constantly. The same genes exhibited a pattern of isolated peaks of expression in the elicited BAPT-overexpressing line.",37772738

Encountering Rhizobium, rapid changes of gene expression levels in host plants occur in the first few hours, which prepare the plants to turn off defence and form a symbiotic relationship with the microbes. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the roots of Medicago truncatula at 30min, 6h and 24h after nod factor treatment. We found drastic global gene expression reprogramming at 30min in the epidermis and cortex and most of these changes were restored at 6h. Moreover, plant defence response genes are activated at 30min and subsequently suppressed at 6h in non-meristem cells. Only in the cortical cells but not in other cell types, we found the flavonoid synthase genes required to recruit rhizobia are highly expressed 30min after inoculation with nod factors. A gene module enriched for symbiotic nitrogen fixation genes showed that MtFER (MtFERONIA) and LYK3 (LysM domain receptor-like kinase 3) share similar responses to symbiotic signals. We further found that MtFER can be phosphorylated by LYK3 and it participates in rhizobial symbiosis.

Using a methodology that allows synchronous inoculation and growth of more than 100 plants in a single media container, we harvested the same segment of each root responding to rhizobia in the initial inoculation over a time course, collected individual tissues from these segments with laser capture microdissection, and created and sequenced RNA libraries generated from these tissues. We demonstrate the utility of the resource by examining the expression patterns of a set of genes induced very early in nodule signaling, as well as two gene families (CLE peptides and nodule specific PLAT-domain proteins) and show that despite similar whole-root expression patterns, there are tissue differences in expression between the genes. Using a rhizobial response dataset generated from transcriptomics on intact root segments, we also examined differential temporal expression patterns and determined that, after nodule tissue, the epidermis and cortical cells contained the most temporally patterned genes. We circumscribed gene lists for each time and tissue examined and developed an expression pattern visualization tool. Finally, we explored transcriptomic differences between the inner cortical cells that become nodules and those that do not, confirming that the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases distinguishes inner cortical cells that become nodules and provide and describe potential downstream genes involved in early nodule cell division.

Our study aimed to isolate rhizobia from root nodules of native D. barbatum, D. incanum, and D. discolor, collected in remnants of the biomes of Atlantic Forest and Cerrado in protected areas of the Paran State, southern Brazil. Based on the 16S rRNA phylogeny, 18 out of 29 isolates were classified as Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium and Allorhizobium/Rhizobium) and 11 as Betaproteobacteria (Paraburkholderia). Phylogeny of the recA gene of the alpha-rhizobia resulted in ten main clades, of which two did not group with any described rhizobial species. In the 16S rRNA phylogeny of the beta-rhizobia, Paraburkholderia strains from the same host and conservation unity occupied the same clade. Phenotypic characterization of representative strains revealed the ability of Desmodium rhizobia to grow under stressful conditions such as high temperature, salinity, low pH conditions, and tolerance of heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds. Contrasting with previous reports, our results revealed that Brazilian native Desmodium can exploit symbiotic interactions with stress-tolerant strains of alpha- and beta-rhizobia. Stress tolerance can highly contribute to the ecological success of Desmodium in this phytogeographic region, possibly relating to its pioneering ability in Brazil.

One-third of bioY genes spread in bacteria cluster with bioM and bioN on the genomes, and the rest does not. Interestingly, some bacteria have the bioY gene clustering with bioB gene, which encodes biotin synthase, an enzyme that converts dethiobiotin to biotin, on their genome.

However, the mechanisms used by nodule-specific LTPs remain unknown. In this study, a functional protein in the DnaJ-like family, designated AsDJL1, was identified and shown to interact with AsE246. Immunofluorescence showed that AsDJL1 was expressed in infection threads (ITs) and in nodule cells and that it co-localized with rhizobium, and an immunoelectron microscopy assay localized the protein to SMs. Via co-transformation into Nicotiana benthamiana cells, AsDJL1 and AsE246 displayed subcellular co-localization in the cells of this heterologous host. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that AsDJL1 interacted with AsE246 in nodules. The essential interacting region of AsDJL1 was determined to be the zinc finger domain at its C-terminus. Chinese milk vetch plants transfected with AsDJL1-RNAi had significantly decreased numbers of ITs, nodule primordia and nodules as well as reduced (by 83%) nodule nitrogenase activity compared with the controls. By contrast, AsDJL1 overexpression led to increased nodule fresh weight and nitrogenase activity. RNAi-AsDJL1 also significantly affected the abundance of lipids, especially digalactosyldiacylglycerol, in early-infected roots and transgenic nodules.

Here, by means of the ramosus (rms) mutants of Pisum sativum (pea) cv Terese, we investigated the impact of strigolactone biosynthesis (rms1 and rms5) and signaling (rms3 and rms4) mutants on nodule growth. The rms mutants had more red, that is, functional, and larger nodules than the wild-type plants. Additionally, the increased nitrogen fixation and senescence zones with consequently reduced meristematic and infection zones indicated that the rms nodules developed faster than the wild-type nodules. An enhanced expression of the nodule zone-specific molecular markers for meristem activity and senescence supported the enlarged, fast maturing nodules. Interestingly, the master nodulation regulator, NODULE INCEPTION, NIN, was strongly induced in nodules of all rms mutants but not prior to inoculation. Determination of sugar levels with both bulk and spatial metabolomics in roots and nodules, respectively, hints at slightly increased malic acid levels early during nodule primordia formation and reduced sugar levels at later stages, possibly the consequence of an increased carbon usage of the enlarged nodules, contributing to the enhanced senescence.

We systematically sampled biocrust layers and underlying subcrust soils (0-5 cm depth), employing metagenomic sequencing and co-occurrence network analysis to characterize microbial community structures and functional properties. SMF was quantified using an integrative index based on ten parameters associated with C, N, and phosphorus (P) cycling processes. Results revealed significant variation in SMF among biocrust types, with moss crusts exhibiting the highest level, followed by lichen and algal crusts. Microbial community characteristics indicated that although lichen crusts showed the highest taxonomic diversity and network complexity, moss crusts showed a significant positive correlation with SMF. Network topological parameters, particularly network density within the biocrust layers, correlated significantly positively with SMF (p < 0.05), contrasting with the non-significant relationship observed for taxonomic diversity. Functional gene analysis revealed that the diversity of C degradation and N cycling genes exhibited a significant positive correlation with SMF. Our findings demonstrate that biocrusts enhance SMF primarily by mediating both direct and indirect effects on N cycling functional gene diversity and microbial network complexity.

Using high-throughput quantitative PCR, we screened for 33 ARGs and three mobile genetic elements (MGEs), quantifying their relative abundance. Bacterial community composition was characterized via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analyses evaluated geographical patterns, co-occurrence between ARGs and bacterial taxa, and the influence of latitude on ARG distribution. Ten ARGs conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes (aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones and sulfonamides), along with one MGE, were detected. The ARGs blaCTX-M-1, qnrB, and qepA were highly prevalent, with qepA often surpassing 16S rRNA gene abundance. Only qnrB showed significantly higher abundance in southern samples. Latitude significantly influenced ARG profiles, whereas bacterial community composition did not. Our findings demonstrate that C. stellaris harbors diverse ARGs in remote boreal ecosystems with limited anthropogenic influence. Proposed explanations for ARG presence include long-distance dispersal via bioaerosols and endogenous development within lichen microbiomes, yet these remain speculative. Future work incorporating bacterial isolation, whole-genome sequencing, metatranscriptomics, air sampling, and metabolomic profiling is necessary to unravel the ecology and evolution of ARGs in natural habitats.",40977499
"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Members of the lichen photobiont genus Trebouxia show species-specific photo-physiological and transcriptome-level responses to high light.,"Members of the common lichen photobiont Trebouxia occur in all terrestrial habitats, from the arctic to the tropics, however, the mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance in Trebouxia are little understood. Currently, lineages belonging to this genus are grouped into clades A, C, I, S, D. Here we study six species, which belong to the S-Clade and A-Clade of Trebouxia, and were isolated from the lichen-forming fungi Umbilicaria pustulata and U. phaea. Three of the Trebouxia species have a climatic niche preference at low elevation (Mediterranean climate), two at high elevation (cold temperate climate), and one is found in both climate zones. These species have demonstrated extensive genomic divergence, particularly in genome regions associated with photosynthesis. Therefore, we hypothesize that they will exhibit differential performance under varying light conditions. We assessed physiological and transcriptomic responses to high light (HL) (control: 60 mol photons/m2/s; HL:150 mol photons/m2/s) using a controlled environmental chamber. We examined the cultures responses after 1 hour and 3 days (12 hours per day) of HL exposure. We measured photo-physiological parameters including maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in combination with differential gene expression analysis via RNASeq. Average levels of Fv/Fm and NPQ showed significant reduction following HL exposure, however, this varied among species. Species from high elevation (i.e. Trebouxia S12 C0006 and A10 C0009) exhibited relatively high NPQ capacity throughout the experiment. There was no significant change in average chl a concentration. Further, only a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found for specific species following exposure to 1 hour HL, including those associated with chloroplast thylakoid membrane, transposon TX1 and photorespiration. On the other hand, there are more DEGs found for all Trebouxia species exposed to prolonged HL, which involved genes associated to DNA biosynthetic process, cell cycle and cell wall organization. Photoprotection-associated genes related to NPQ, photosystem II repair, oxygen evolving assembly and biosynthesis of photoprotective pigments (carotenoid and chl) also showed differential expression due to prolonged HL. Overall, our findings show that in Trebouxia the capacity to withstand high light conditions is highly species-specific, and not driven by phylogenetic relatedness, or climatic niche preference. We do not observe parallel patterns in species preferring similar climatic niches, with the exception of species from high elevation (Trebouxia S12 C0006 and A10 C0009), which exhibit generally high NPQ capacity.",40973683

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the family history and genetic characteristics of 14 independent MEN2A pedigrees, all carrying exon 10 mutations of the RET gene, from July 2003 to August 2023. A total of 74 out of 133 participants carried germline mutations in exon 10 of the RET gene. The cohort included 26 males and 48 females, with nine types of mutations observed: p.C609R, p.C611F/Y, p.C618G/R/S/Y and p.C620R/S. Of these, the C618 mutation was the most prevalent (71.6%), followed by p.C611 (22.9%), p.C620 (4.1%), and p.C609 (1.4%). The penetrance rates for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, hirschsprung disease, and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis were 90.3%, 6.9%, 2.8%, 1.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Among the 72 patients with available clinical information, 41 (56.9%) exhibited symptoms of MTC. Comparison of the age at diagnosis, size of MTC, and the positive rate of cervical lymph node metastasis (N1) revealed significant differences between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic MTC (all P<0.05). There was a significant difference in the positivity rate of N1 between patients with the p.C618/C620 mutations and those with the p.C609/C611 mutations. Additionally, there was a significant difference in the initial serum calcitonin levels between N1 and N0 patients (P<0.05).

This study aimed to screen for OLP-related hub genes and construct a network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to explore the crucial mechanisms involved in the disease. Proteomic and transcriptomic sequencing were performed on oral mucosa collected from OLP patients and healthy participants, respectively. Limma package was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and RNAs between groups. Shared genes between DEPs and DE mRNAs (DEGs) were subjected to functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to screen for OLP-related genes. Furthermore, the OLP-related genes in the most significant PPI modules were defined as key genes, and LASSO analysis was further used to screen hub genes from the key genes. The area under curve (AUC) value was calculated from receiver operating characteristic curves to assess the diagnostic efficacy of hub genes. Finally, a ceRNAs regulatory network was constructed, and the hub genes were validated using qPCR analysis. In the disease group, 103 shared DEGs (85 upregulated and 18 downregulated) were identified from both transcriptomic and proteomic data. These DEGs were involved in pathways such as antigen processing and presentation. COTL1, OAS2, HLA-A, and HLA-DPA1 were identified as hub genes. They had good diagnostic efficacy for OLP, with all AUC value exceeding 0.7 based on the transcriptomic and proteomic data. LncRNA MIR155HG regulated COTL1 and OAS2 by competitively binding to hsa-miR-1233-5p. Moreover, PCR analysis validated that these four hub genes were all highly expressed in OLP tissue compared with control tissue (<i>P</i> < 0.05). mRNAs, proteins and non-coding RNAs provide clues to study the mechanisms of OLP.

However, its molecular mechanisms are not clearly understood. This study investigates p53 gene mutations in OLP lesions. This study analyzed 43 paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from OLP patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by two pathologists. Genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial kit, with quality and quantity assessed by spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR-sequencing was performed on exons 5-8 and part of the adjacent introns of the p53 gene. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20, with Fisher's exact test and t-test applied to assess relationships between p53 mutations and clinical parameters; significance was set at p<0.05. The study included 43 OLP cases (mean age 51.713.3 years; 65.1% female). Lesions were most frequently located on the buccal mucosa (65.1%), followed by the tongue (20.9%), gingiva (19.3%), and mandible (4.7%). DNA sequencing identified 13 nucleotide changes in the p53 gene in 9 samples (20.9%), distributed across exons 5-7 and intronic regions at codons 140, 171, 185, 213, and 246, as well as at IVS4:+8(C/G), IVS7: -11(A/C), and IVS4: -18(A/T). Mutations included equal proportions of missense and silent changes, as well as transitions and transversions. Adenine mutations were most common (53.8%), followed by cytosine mutations (30.8%). No statistically significant associations were found between p53 mutations and patient gender, age, or anatomical site of sampling. The study identified p53 gene mutations in 21% of oral lichen planus (OLP) cases, with no demographic or pathological correlations.

Despite overlapping histopathology, their molecular differences remain poorly defined. We performed the first systematic review and transcriptomic meta-analysis of human scalp biopsies in PLSAs (PROSPERO: CRD42024559969), following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Of 1,080 records screened, eight studies met inclusion criteria; six were eligible for meta-analysis, and two were qualitatively reviewed. The batch-corrected meta-analysis identified shared and subtype-specific transcriptomic alterations. Common features included Th1/IFN and JAK/STAT activation, cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration, and downregulation of epithelial keratins. FFA and LPP showed strong immune activation, while CCCA exhibited lower inflammation but increased mitochondrial stress, lipid metabolism disruption, and fibroblast-associated remodeling. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed convergent and divergent molecular modules spanning immune, fibrotic, metabolic, and epigenetic pathways. LPP was uniquely enriched for gene signatures linked to cardiovascular traits, suggesting novel systemic associations. Drug repurposing analyses identified candidate compounds modulating inflammation and metabolism, some reversing inflammatory signatures in brepocitinib-treated samples.

This study aimed to evaluate the expression level of miR-let-7a in OSCC and OLP patients, and to compare it with healthy controls, to determine its potential as an early diagnostic marker. In this cross-sectional study, serum samples were collected from 36 OSCC patients, 38 OLP patients, and 38 healthy controls. Diagnosis of OSCC and OLP was confirmed via biopsy. Serum RNA was isolated, and after quality verification, cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess miR-let-7a expression across the three groups.

However, dysbiosis inside lesion tissue and its correlation with gene expression in male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLSc) remain elusive. This study investigated the influence of host-microbe interactions on dysbiosis and differential gene expression in MGLSc. Microbiome and transcriptome sequencing were conducted using prepuce samples from 27 MGLSc patients and 17 controls. We also performed immunohistochemistry staining of bacterial markers on prepuce tissue from two cohorts. Furthermore, potential risk factor information available from the MGLSc clinical data was collected and correlated with the differential microbiota. Unclassified Muribaculaceae and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were enriched, while <i>Finegoldia magna</i>, <i>Prevotella timonensis</i>, <i>Bacillus pumilus</i>, and <i>Peptoniphilus harei</i>, etc., were reduced in MGLSc tissues and decreased in gram-positive bacteria (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with immune activation, inflammatory response, innate immunity, and pathogen response. DEGs related to pathogen recognition, such as <i>TLR1</i>, <i>TLR2</i>, <i>TLR6</i>, and <i>HLA-DOB</i>, were upregulated (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis revealed MGLSc lesions enriched immune cells. Clinical correlation analysis indicated that differential microbota was negatively correlated with age (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and stricture grade (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and was positively correlated with total cholesterol levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05), body mass index (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and triglyceride levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Our study provides preliminary clues on host-microbe interactions in MGLSc development, suggesting that tissue dysbiosis may be associated with localized immune dysregulation. Our study combined full-length 16S rDNA sequencing, transcriptome data, and clinical information from MGLSc patients to explore the relationships between host-microbe interactions and the development of tissue dysbiosis in MGLSc. Importantly, through staining for lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, as well as full-length 16S rDNA sequencing, we identified, for the first time, the presence of microorganisms distribution pattern in lichen sclerosus prepuce tissue. Significant differences in the abundance of unclassified Muribaculaceae, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Finegoldia magna</i>, and other taxa were observed between the prepuce of MGLSc patients and controls. These differences were associated with altered gene expression in MGLSc patients, while the differential microbiota, in turn, influenced host gene expression.

"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Central metabolism and development are rewired in lichenized cyanobacteria.,"Nostoc cyanobacteria are among the few organisms capable of fixing both carbon and nitrogen. These metabolic features are essential for the cyanolichen symbiosis, where Nostoc supplies both carbon (as glucose) and nitrogen (as ammonium) to a cyanolichen-forming fungal partner. This nutrient flow was established by seminal biochemical studies published in the 20th century. Since then, cyanolichen metabolism has received little attention, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the physiology of lichenized Nostoc remain mostly unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the genomic and transcriptional changes that enable Nostoc's metabolic role in cyanolichens. We used comparative genomics across 243 genomes of Nostoc s. lat. coupled with metatranscriptomic experiments using Peltigera cyanolichens. We found that genes for photoautotrophic carbon fixation are upregulated in lichenized Nostoc. This likely results in a higher rate of carbon fixation that allows Nostoc to provide carbon to the fungal partner while meeting its own metabolic needs. We also found that the transfer of ammonium from Nostoc to the lichen-forming fungus is facilitated by two molecular mechanisms: (i) transcriptional downregulation of glutamine synthetase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonium assimilation in Nostoc; and (ii) frequent losses of a putative high-affinity ammonium permease, which likely reduces Nostoc's capacity to recapture leaked ammonium. Finally, we found that the development of motile hormogonia is downregulated in lichenized Nostoc, which resembles the repression of motility in Nostoc symbionts after they colonize symbiotic cavities of their plant hosts.

To address this gap, we characterized the chloroplast genome of Chloroidium sp. W5, a photobiont of the lichen Peltigera elisabethae, using next-generation sequencing. The circular genome (190,579 bp) was assembled and annotated using a combination of bioinformatics tools, including GetOrganelle for genome assembly and GeSeq for annotation. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genome's structure, gene content, and repetitive elements. Codon usage patterns were assessed using MEGA 11, and phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum likelihood analysis with IQ-tree. The circular genome (190,579 bp) lacks the canonical quadripartite structure (LSC/IR/SSC) and exhibits a strong AT bias (56.1%). Annotation identified 110 functional genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 28 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs.

This cross-sectional case-control study aimed to characterize the supragingival plaque microbiota and microbial interaction networks in erosive OLP (E-OLP), non-erosive OLP (NE-OLP), and healthy controls (HCs), to elucidate microbial patterns associated with disease severity. <b>Methods</b>: Supragingival plaque samples were collected from 90 participants (30 per group) and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity metrics, differential abundance, and co-occurrence network analyses were performed. <b>Results</b>: E-OLP exhibited pronounced dysbiosis, including the enrichment of pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Parvimonas</i>) and depletion of health-associated commensals (e.g., <i>Rothia</i>, <i>Capnocytophaga</i>). Network analysis revealed the stepwise disintegration of microbial community structure from HC to NE-OLP to E-OLP, with reduced connectivity and increased dominance of pathogenic clusters in E-OLP. These microbial alterations aligned with clinical findings, as E-OLP patients showed significantly higher Reticulation/keratosis, Erythema, and Ulceration (REU) scores for erythema and ulceration compared to NE-OLP. <b>Conclusions</b>: Supragingival plaque dysbiosis and ecological disruption are strongly associated with OLP severity and subtype.

Surgical treatment of high-grade VIN often leads to genital deformity, reduced quality of life and reduced sexual function, which has a major impact on quality of life. To optimize clinical management, accurate biomarkers providing information on the cancer risk of high-grade VIN are needed. To investigate the prognostic value of a three-gene methylation marker panel and other potential risk factors for the risk of progression to cancer in patients with HSIL and dVIN. From a population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with high-grade VIN, patients with a histopathological confirmed diagnosis of HSIL (n=578) and dVIN (n=46) were selected. All lesions were tested for a three-gene methylation panel including genes ZNF582, SST, and miR124-2. The vulvar cancer risk and the prognostic value of methylation, age, HPV genotype, p53 immunohistochemistry status, and presence of lichen sclerosus were estimated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression, respectively. Vulvar cancer developed in 26/578 (4.5%) HSIL patients and in 21/46 (45.7%) dVIN patients within five years. In patients with HSIL, a positive methylation status was identified as the only prognostic factor for vulvar cancer development (HR 4.87; 95%CI 1.20-21.45). The prognostic value of methylation remained present when selecting patients who did not receive radical surgical excision as their primary treatment. In this group, the 5-year cancer risk was 7.7% in methylation-positive HSIL and 1.4% in methylation-negative HSIL (p=0.008). In patients with dVIN, p53 status was the sole prognostic risk factor for progression to cancer (HR 7.67; 95% CI 1.78-33.08). Despite wide confidence intervals, the three-gene methylation test serves as a promising prognostic tool for cancer risk stratification in patients with vulvar HSIL. Patients with methylation-negative HSIL carry a low cancer risk, allowing for more conservative management strategies.

CD8 effector memory T cells (Tem) and macrophages infiltrated hair follicles in LPP, disrupting immune privilege and promoting scarring. Heightened interferon- (IFN-) signaling and STAT1 activation in Tem cells caused epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Additionally, macrophage-secreted oncostatin M (OSM) impaired HFSC integrity. These mechanisms drive LPP's inflammation and fibrosis.

"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",The avoidance response in plant root to the environmental pollutant triclosan.,"Triclosan (TCS), an antimicrobial agent commonly found in personal care products and disinfectants, has raised concerns due to its potential risks for human health and environment. In this study, we observed and investigated an avoidance response in Arabidopsis roots, which exhibited directional growth away from TCS-containing medium. Genetic screening of the mutants impaired in salt stress, abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin, and auxin signaling pathways revealed that polar auxin transport is essential for mediating this TCS-induced root response. Notably, TCS application downregulated the expression level of auxin transporter proteins AUX1 and PIN2 in the root meristem. These findings highlight the regulatory role of polar auxin transport in directing root growth reorientation in response to TCS, enabling plants to avoid from adverse environmental conditions. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to environmental pollutants offers valuable insights for developing strategies to reduce pollutant uptake and accumulation in crops, thereby enhancing food safety and supporting human health.",40664074
"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Speciation continuum in non-model organisms: Revisiting the species-pair concept in lichens.,"Evolutionary biologists have long pursued understanding the continuum in which populations flow, interact, and evolve, which can ultimately lead to divergence into distinct species. Lichens, which are often defined as intricate ecosystems, exhibit remarkable evolutionary mechanisms that challenge conventional definitions of speciation. A particularly notable phenomenon in lichens is the species-pair concept, in which closely related taxa only differ in their reproductive strategies - one reproducing sexually, the other asexually. We investigated this concept in the iconic beard-like lichen Usnea by comparing three species pairs: U. aurantiacoatra/U. antarctica, U. florida/U. subfloridana and U. intermedia/U. perplexans. Using reference-based RADseq data and applying multivariate and model-based genomic population methods, we evaluated genomic differentiation across each pair. Our results revealed a gradient of divergence: U. aurantiacoatra/U. antarctica showed strong lineage separation with no genomic admixture, U. intermedia/U. perplexans exhibited moderate differentiation with signs of gene flow, and U. florida/U. subfloridana formed a largely unstructured clade with substantial genomic overlap. These findings place the three species pairs at different positions along the speciation continuum and highlight reproductive mode as a key factor influencing lineage divergence. Our study reframes the species-pair concept within a continuum framework and provides new genomic insights from a non-model system, enhancing our understanding of speciation in lichen-forming fungi.",40651545

This study aims to investigate the alterations in oral microbiota and metabolites in OLP patients with psychiatric symptoms, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of OLP. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to evaluate the oral microbial population in a cohort of 105 OLP patients. To further investigate the potential interaction between OLP and psychiatric factors, saliva samples from 64 depressed/anxious OLP patients (D-OLP) and their age-matched healthy controls were selected for 16S rRNA sequencing. The salivary metabolome was also characterized by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results of 16S rRNA sequencing showed that significant differences in species classification between OLP patients and healthy controls. The D-OLP group displayed an increased abundance of Pseudomonas as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities. Correlation analysis showed that the altered metabolites were involved in the metabolic pathways related to the oral-microbiome-brain axis and affected various physiological processes such as neurotransmitter transmission and oxidative stress, promoting epithelial inflammatory activation and immune responses. These changes ultimately lead to the destruction of the original oral mucosal homeostasis. Psychiatric factors may promote mucosal inflammatory responses through dysbiosis of the microbiota.

The combination of fungal and algal partners changes along climate gradients in many species, and is expected to be adaptive. However, the functional mechanisms behind this symbiosis-mediated environmental adaptation are unknown. We investigated which transcriptional profiles are associated with specific fungal-algal symbiont pairings found in lichens from high-elevation (Lower Supratemperate) and low-elevation (Lower Mesomediterranean) sites at two extremes of a climatic gradient on Mount Limbara, Sardinia. Using laboratory-acclimatized thalli, we found that lichen fungal and algal symbionts show variable expression profiles between high- and low-elevation individuals: circadian- and temperature-associated genes for fungi and light-responsive genes for algae show climate-specific patterns. High- and low-elevation individuals differentially express sugar transporters in both symbionts, pointing to symmetrical and climate-dependent sugar transport mechanisms between them. A light pulse treatment identified asymmetries between fungal and algal light responses, with high- and low-elevation fungal symbionts but only low-elevation algal symbionts showing a response.

The study included 230 individuals with OPMD conditions (70 with leukoplakia, 90 with oral submucous fibrosis, and 70 with lichen planus), 72 oral cancer patients, and 300 cancer-free healthy controls. Genotyping of the p16 450C>G polymorphism was conducted using PCR-RFLP methods, and genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed using chi-square test. Additionally, p16 gene expression levels were measured using RT-PCR among oral cancer patients, those with OPMD, and healthy controls. RNA fold was used to calculate the MFE of p16 mRNA. The findings revealed that G allele of p16 450C>G polymorphism significantly increased risk of oral diseases (oral cancer and OPMD) compared to C allele (OR 1.67, p=0.0001). GG genotype was associated with higher risk of oral submucous fibrosis (OR 4.63, p=0.0001), lichenplanus (OR 3.93, p=0.0002), and leukoplakia (OR 2.38, p=0.02) compared to CC genotype. Smokers and tobacco chewers carrying the G allele were at a significantly increased risk of developing OPMD (OR=3.78 and 2.89).

OLP was induced in mice by transplanting human OLP lesions into the backs of thymus-free mice, and an invitro cell model was constructed using LPS-stimulated HaCaT cells. Gene intervention was performed using shRNA lentiviral vectors. The secretion of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-, as well as the rate of apoptosis in HaCaT cells, was also assessed. ChIP assay and dual-luciferase assay were used to validate the transcriptional regulation of S100A7 by nuclear factor 1 A-type (NFIA). The expression of S100A7 was significantly elevated in the lesion tissues of OLP-induced mice. Knockdown of S100A7 alleviated inflammation and reduced keratinocyte apoptosis. The transcription factor NFIA repressed S100A7 expression by binding to the S100A7 promoter. The overexpression of NFIA ameliorated inflammation invivo and reduced apoptosis invitro, which was abrogated by further overexpression of S100A7.

We collected 40 preputial samples and 14 urethral tissue samples from patients with MGLSc-US, non-MGLSc urethral strictures, and redundant prepuce. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to comprehensively profile the transcriptome. Molecular subtypes, functional features, and gene signatures were identified in MGLSc prepuce and urethral lesions. Additionally, we examined the histological and clinical features specific to each subtype. Two distinct transcriptomic subtypes in preputial lesions were identified. Subtype 1 was characterized by the upregulation of immune pathways and increased lymphocytic stromal infiltration. Subtype 2 showed an upregulation of epithelial cell proliferation and cellular stress response pathways.

Accordingly, the present study selected 28 multimodal phytochemicals (P1 to P28) and further assessed their potency and drug-ability using computer-aided drug design (CADD) and experimental methods. At first, the putative targets for OLP were selected through network pharmacology, and then molecular docking scores with predicted drug-ability profiles recommended that P12 (epicatechin gallate/ECG) be the lead candidate among all.

However, how different microbial taxa respond to microhabitat heterogeneity, ecological strategies such as functional redundancy and specialization contribute to adaptation in extreme environments remains underexplored. To address these questions, we employed high-throughput 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing in combination with GeoChip-based functional gene profiling to assess the structure and functional potential of microbial communities across moss, lichen and soil microhabitats in Antarctic ice-free terrestrial ecosystem. Microhabitat type has a greater influence on microbial community structure and function in the ice-free Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem than geographical location. Though all prokaryotic communities were dominated by Pseudomonadota, Nostoc and Endobacter were significantly enriched in the moss and lichen microhabitats, respectively. Meanwhile, all fungal communities were primarily dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with Byssoloma and Usnea showing significant enrichment in the moss and lichen microhabitats, respectively. Despite these taxonomic differences, the three microhabitats show similar core ecological functions with widespread microbial functional redundancy. Nevertheless, clear microhabitat-specific functional specialization was suggested. For example, moss microhabitat was enriched in Pyoverdin_pvcC and Zeaxanthin_glucosyltransferase, sdhA, lichen microhabitat harbored higher levels of nhaA, nikC, vacuolar_iron_transport, mttB, glucoamylase, pel_Cdeg, pme_Cdeg, rgh, rgl, while soil microhabitat was enriched in 5f1_ppn and isopullulanase.

This review assesses and integrates research concerning the influence of VDR gene variants on the development of tobacco-related oral cancer, emphasizing genetic underpinnings of individual vulnerability and possible tailored preventative approaches. The search strategy for this systematic review and meta-analysis was devised to comprehensively identify relevant studies from diverse sources. The investigation included three primary components: the VDR gene, oral cancer, and tobacco. The data from the papers included in the study were independently retrieved by two reviewers. The incidence was evaluated as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using SPSS software. A preliminary search of biomedical electronic research databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) yielded 60,345 papers. After multi-phase exclusions, five studies met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis highlights interactions between genetic polymorphisms, smoking, aging, and oral health risks. The CYP24A1 (rs2296241) heterozygote genotype significantly reduces oral cancer risk (OR=0.281, <i>P</i>=0.00001). Variants rs1544410 and rs2228570 influence oral health outcomes.

These BGCs are primarily involved in toxins production and defense-related functions and resulting metabolites also have a significant therapeutic potential. While only a limited number of fungal RiPPs, primarily from a few model fungi, have been characterized, genome mining approaches show that RiPP BGCs are nearly ubiquitous across the fungal kingdom. However, the RiPP biosynthetic landscape of fungi involved in intricate relationship as symbiosis, such as lichen-forming fungi (LFF), remains unexplored. This study presents the first comprehensive survey of RiPP BGCs across 111 LFF genomes employing an integrative framework that combines genome mining, phylogenetic inference, and gene network reconstruction. We identified 987 RiPP BGCs, constituting approximately 17% of the total biosynthetic diversity in LFF, a proportion significantly higher than previously estimated. Most lichen RiPP BGCs are unique and do not cluster with any known RiPP gene cluster. We found two RiPP BGCs that were shared among the members of the family Parmeliaceae (Lecanoromycetes), with the signature gene homologous to ustiloxin signature enzyme, indicating a putative similarity to fungal mycotoxin-related BGCs. While one of these BGCs, members of Clan R1, contains the accessory genes for dikaritin synthesis (tyrosinase and methyltransferase), the accessory genes of other BGCs, members of Clan R2, have not yet been reported from any characterized fungal RiPP BGC but only from bacteria. Additionally, for lichen RiPP BGCs that do not cluster with any known BGCs in the RiPP network, we unraveled the presence of the conserved HXXHC motif in the signature gene and, based on this we report the widespread distribution of putative dikaritin homologs across Lecanoromycetes. This study highlights the presence and distribution of RiPP BGCs in Lecanoromycetes and identifies two conserved RiPP clusters putatively homologous to dikaritins (involved in mycotoxin production) within the Lecanoromycete family Parmeliaceae and a general prevalence of putative signature dikaritin genes (not the cluster) in Lecanoromycetes.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to confirm the binding of p65 and NF-B element in the promoter of the human PARK7 gene. The Caspase 3 and NF-B detection kits were used for Caspase 3 and NF-B activities measurement. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was applied to test the protein-protein interactions in HOKs. The levels of PARK7 were up-regulated in the diseased oral keratinocytes derived from OLP patients compared to those from healthy donors. Mechanistically, the activated NF-B pathway could increase PARK7 gene transcription in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). Moreover, PARK7 deletion facilitated cell apoptosis and NF-B activation in HOKs under OLP conditions. Overexpression of PARK7 could suppress cell apoptosis and NF-B activation in the OLP cell model. At the molecular level, PARK7 could interact with BAX and p65 to inhibit cell apoptosis and NF-B activation in HOKs, respectively.

Previously, we utilized <i>A. rabiei</i> as a heterologous host to produce a lichen-derived polyketide with anticancer activities. This study aimed to establish <i>A. rabiei</i> as a sustainable biorefinery for production of biologically active compounds through two objectives: optimizing culture conditions on agricultural waste substrates for polyketide production and generating a clean host using the Cre-loxP system for reusable antibiotic resistance markers. We found that soy hull is the most effective substrate among lignocellulosic materials.

Lipid metabolism dysregulation has been implicated in tumor development and immune response modulation. This study aims to explore the role of lipid metabolism, particularly the lipids diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerol (TAG), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), in the progression from OLP to OSCC, and to identify potential therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationships between lipid metabolism and the risk of OLP and OSCC. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted to identify key genes related to lipid metabolism. The interactions of lipid species and key genes were examined using drug databases (DrugBank, DGIdb, and TCMSP) to explore potential drug candidates. Enrichment analysis of signaling pathways, including PPAR signaling, was also conducted to understand the underlying mechanisms. Our MR analysis revealed that DAG exerts a protective effect in OLP (OR<1), but its role shifts to a risk factor in OSCC (OR>1), potentially by altering the tumor immune microenvironment. TAG and PI dysregulation also plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Gene expression analysis identified several key lipid metabolism-related genes, including SLC27A6, FABP3, FABP4, ADIPOQ, and PLIN1, whose expression differed between OLP and OSCC, highlighting their importance in tumor progression. These genes were enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway, suggesting its involvement in tumor growth and immune modulation. Potential drug candidates, such as palm acid (PA), Imatinib, and Curcumin, were identified through drug-repurposing strategies. Lipid metabolism dysregulation plays a crucial role in the progression of OLP to OSCC. Targeting key lipid metabolism pathways and genes, such as DAG, TAG, PI, and the PPAR pathway, may offer promising strategies for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.

Identifying molecular biomarkers showing differential circadian (DC) patterns between biological conditions or disease status is important for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, circadian pattern is characterized by three key components: amplitude, phase, and MESOR, which poses a great challenge for DC analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting differential shape (amplitude and phase) but often overlook MESOR difference. Additionally, these methods lack flexibility to incorporate external knowledge such as differential circadian information from similar clinical and biological context to improve the current DC analysis. To address these limitation, we introduce a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, BayesDCirc, designed for detecting differential circadian patterns in a two-group experimental design, which offer the advantage of testing MESOR difference and incorporating external knowledge. Benefiting from explicitly testing MESOR within the Bayesian modeling framework, BayesDCirc demonstrates superior FDR control over existing methods, with further performance improvement by leveraging external knowledge of DC genes.

Accordingly, the objective of this study is to unravel the intricate mechanism behind the repair of pancreatic injury in TP rats. <b>Methods:</b> A gene interaction network of miRNA was constructed based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE 159814). Our investigation was divided into two groups, and appropriate controls were implemented for each group. The expression levels of inflammatory factors in each group were detected, along with the pathological damage of pancreatic tissue, the percentage of apoptotic cells, and key mRNA and protein expression levels. <b>Results:</b> The miRNA-mRNA gene interaction network suggests that hsa-miR-21-5p/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are positioned at the core of this interaction network. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and histological examination (HE) results suggest that pancreatic damage increased in the miR-21 inhibitor and EXW groups, whereas it decreased in the miR-21 activator and EXC groups compared to the EX group. PCR, western blot (WB), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) results indicate that hucMSC-Ex carrying hsa-miR-21-5p suppresses excessive activation of PTEN by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), exerting therapeutic effects. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study has discovered that hucMSC-Ex effectively inhibits the translation of PTEN via the transported hsa-miR-21-5p, consequently affecting the PI3K/serine-threonine kinase (AKT) signaling pathway.

Additionally, it sought to compare the inflammatory lesion microenvironments of OLP and LP by analyzing key immune pathways and cellular interactions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 16 OLP patients and 5healthy controls. Single-cell transcriptomic data from PBMCs and lesion tissues of OLP and LP were analyzed to profile immune and inflammatory signatures. Key molecular findings were validated using independent datasets and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

DCN is increasingly attracting attention due to its significant role in tumors, fibrotic diseases, and the regulation of vascular formation. Moreover, its anti-tumor properties have positioned it as a promising biomarker in the fight against cancer. Numerous studies have confirmed that DCN can exert inhibitory effects in various solid tumors, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), by activating its downstream pathways through binding with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor, or by stabilizing and enhancing the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 to mediate apoptosis in cancer cells that have undergone mutation. The occurrence of OSCC is a continuous and dynamic process, encompassing the transition from normal mucosa to oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), and further progressing from OPMDs to the malignant transformation into OSCC. We have found that DCN may exhibit a bidirectional effect in the progression of oral mucosal carcinogenesis, showing a trend of initial elevation followed by a decline, which decreases with the differentiation of OSCC. In OPMDs, DCN exhibits high expression and may be associated with malignant transformation, possibly linked to the increased expression of P53 in OPMDs.

All ODGM-positive OLK cases were located in the tongue, a site associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation compared with those in other oral sites. Moreover, ODGMs were significantly associated with alcohol consumption. While there was a tendency for mutations to increase with higher grades, we found no significant correlation between the presence of ODGMs and oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) grade. Notably, in the case of OLP with ODGM, the lesion histopathologically developed OED during the follow-up period, indicating an increased risk of cancer development and that cases with identified ODGMs require early surgical excision.

Phenotypic data on the <i>RET</i> C611Y variant remain sparse. Consequently, we aimed to establish a clinical risk profile. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a nationwide study of all cases (n = 128) born after 1 January 1930 and recognized as carrying the <i>RET</i> C611Y variant in Denmark before 1 April 2021. <b>Results</b>: The median follow-up after birth was 47 years (range, 3-92). Age-related penetrance at age 70 years for MTC was 98% (CI, 91-100), for PHEO 24% (CI, 16-37), and for PHPT 10% (CI, 5-20). None had CLA or Hirschsprung's disease. The age-related progression of MTC was significant (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The mean age at T0N0M0 was 16 years (CI, 1220), at T1-4N0M0 38 years (CI, 3442), at TxN1M0 45 years (CI, 3853) and at TxNxM1 49 years (CI, 3661). At the last follow-up, 56% of thyroidectomized cases (n = 103) were biochemically cured. Overall survival at 70 years was 74% (CI, 59-84). <b>Conclusions</b>: <i>RET</i> C611Y is associated with a very high penetrance of MTC and a low penetrance of PHEO and PHPT. CLA and Hirschsprung's disease almost never occur. MTC seems moderately aggressive, but large variability can be seen. Overall survival may be comparable to that of the general population.",39941743

The specific MMPs secreted by keratinocytes in OLP lesions and relevant regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of MMPs in OLP pathogenesis, focusing on their expression in keratinocytes and regulatory mechanisms. <i>MMP</i> mRNA expression in OLP epithelium was analyzed using RNA sequencing data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

The purpose of this study was to explore how TRPV1 mediated <i>P. melaninogenica</i>-induced inflammation. Meanwhile, we aimed to unravel how IL-36 dysregulated the barrier function in oral keratinocytes. Here, the expression of TRPV1, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and its receptor receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) in OLP patients were detected. <i>Prevotella melaninogenica</i> (<i>P. melaninogenica</i>) was used to build a mouse model of oral chronic inflammation. Normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) stimulated by <i>P. melaninogenica</i> were used to examine TRPV1 activation and CGRP release. To investigate the effect of exogenous CGRP on Interleukin-36 gamma (IL-36) expression in NHOKs and bacterial viability, <i>P. melaninogenica</i> and NHOKs were treated with it, respectively. Recombinant IL-36 protein was used to probe its regulation of oral epithelial barrier function. TRPV1, CGRP, and RAMP1 were substantially expressed in OLP. <i>P. melaninogenica</i> increased TRPV1 expression in mice and caused the release of CGRP and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines via activating TRPV1 in NHOKs. Blockade of TRPV1 suppressed <i>P. melaninogenica</i>-induced inflammation. CGRP boosted the production of IL-36 released by NHOKs, resulting in lower expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1).

We utilized sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics to explore gene expression in a cohort of patients with HPVi and HPVd VSCC. We analysed gene expression in distinct areas (SCC, inflammation, LS, HSIL) from four early-stage VSCC cases (two HPVi, two HPVd) using the 10 Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics platform. Cell-specific type expression was inferred using CIBERSORTx. 28,183 Visium spots were detected; each contained an estimated 20-50 cells. Reads per spot ranged from 9903 to 68,527. More genes were upregulated in HPVd (N=601) than HPVi (N=72) with distinct differences in Keratin and Collagen genes between etiologies. Gene expression was strikingly similar between SCC and adjacent inflammatory areas, regardless of etiology. IL-17 signaling was upregulated in HPVd samples. Surprisingly, CIBERSORTx inferred significantly more CD45+ cells in HPVi tissues than HPVd, especially CD4+ resting memory and follicular helper T cells in SCC areas. Immune cells moved from resting states in the pre-invasive tissues to activated states in the SCC and peri-tumoral inflammatory areas.

Bulk RNA sequencing of skin biopsies revealed a high expression of DAPK1 in LP compared with that in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. DAPK1 expression in human keratinocytes was induced by IFN-, TNF, and IL-32. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DAPK1 knockout led to a decreased rate of cell death and induction of proapoptotic proteins (BAX, cPARP) in human keratinocytes upon stimulation with the supernatant T cells derived from LP skin biopsies. Meanwhile, DAPK1 knockout resulted in an induction of kinases involved in necroptosis (RIPK3) and an upregulation of inflammatory genes (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL32, CCL2) after stimulation with LP supernatant T cells.

Sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene of eukaryotes from seven locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada, allowed for the detection of five genera of parasites in caribou feces (including Nematodirella and Parelaphostrongylus) with variable frequency of occurrence depending on sampling location and sex. Our workflow also revealed a rich winter plant and lichen diet in caribou, with respectively 29 and 18 genera identified across all samples through plant and fungal ITS2 sequencing. Relationships between the gut microbiota and both the diet and parasite richness were also identified. Of note, the Central Saskatchewan sampling location was characterized by a clearly distinct gut microbiota which could be linked to an epiphytic lichen-rich diet. Overall, our results showed the potential of this multi-marker DNA metabarcoding workflow as an efficient tool to provide insights into the species biology and ecology.",39543233

Lichen planus (LP) is an idiopathic inflammatory skin disease of unclear etiology. The role of SIRPG gene dysregulation in T1D and LP remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) using matched samples was employed to study causal relationship between T1D and increased risk of LP. T1D-related single nucleotide polymorphism identification was conducted. Datasets GSE156035 for T1D and GSE52130 for LP were obtained from gene expression omnibus. Differentially expressed genes were identified, analyses included weighted gene co-expression network analysis, functional enrichment, gene set enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network construction and analysis. Heatmaps of gene expression levels were generated. Comparative toxicogenomics database was used to identify diseases most relevant to core genes. Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median methods estimated genetic predisposition between T1D and LP, showing consistent positive correlations using both weighted median and inverse variance weighted methods. Horizontal pleiotropy analysis with MR-Egger intercept indicated no evidence of significant directional pleiotropy (P=.70645) for LP. There was no evidence of directional pleiotropy effects between T1D and LP. One hundred eighteen differentially expressed genes were identified. In biological processes, they were mainly enriched in apoptosis, inflammatory response, insulin receptor signaling pathway, glucose metabolism. In cellular components, enrichment was observed in mediator complex and replication fork. In molecular function, they were concentrated in leukotriene receptor activity and helicase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed enrichment in metabolic pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications.

A thorough review of the literature reveals very limited research about MUC1 & 4 expressionsin oral malignancies and oralpremalignant disorders. The aim of the research is to assess the pattern and quantity of gene expression in MUC1 & MUC4 individually in various grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), oral premalignant disorders (OPMDs)- oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), oral lichen planus (OLP), and compared with normal oral mucosa (NOM). Immunohistochemistry and qRTPCR evaluation of MUC1 & 4 on sixty-three cases of OSCC, OPMD, and NOM was accomplished. The one-way ANOVA test and Chi-square test were done for statistical analysis. The overall immunoexpression of MUC1 & 4 increased significantly from NOM to OPMDs to OSCC. In the subgrades of OSCC and OPMDs, the staining intensity varied. For MUC4, the intensity was strongest in well-differentiated grades and MUC1, exhibiting a higher expression in poorly differentiated grades of OSCC and OPMDs. The study's results indicate that MUC1 & 4 individually are crucial formonitoringOSCC and OPMD pathogenesis as the former gives an idea of highly undifferentiated grades while the latter indicated more differentiated tumors and perhaps a better prognosis.

Discovery of molecular and pathogenic mechanisms related to the development of CD tumors has increased in recent years, almost two-thirds of the somatic variants cases have been linked to the USP8 gene, while very rare germline variants in MEN1 and AIP genes have been associated with pituitary adenomas. Variants affecting theRET proto-oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and differentiation, are implicated in the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and its hereditary form, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). This genetic syndrome is also associated with extra-thyroidal manifestations, such as pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, Hirschsprung's disease, mucosal neuromas, or cutaneous lichen amyloidosis. In both hereditary and sporadic forms of MTC, genetic testing is essential for promoting preventive strategies for first-degree relatives and facilitating early diagnosis. We report a case of a 35-year-old male with a history of hypertension, bilateral carotid artery aneurysms, and intracranial fusiform dolichoectasia, with clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. Laboratory investigation confirmed ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism. However, magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any pituitary tumor. A bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling confirmed the diagnosis of CD. The patient underwent successful transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery to remove the corticotropinoma, resulting in significant biochemical and clinical improvement. Due to the patient history of multiple vascular abnormalities and the suspicion of a possible genetic connective tissue disorder, comprehensive genetic testing with whole exome sequencing was performed, identifying a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RET (c.2410G>T p.{Val804Leu}). This variant has been previously associated with MEN2 manifestations and described as having a moderate risk for aggressive MTC and a low risk for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. Genetic testing of available first-degree relatives for the RET variant was negative. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of Cushing disease in a patient with aRET variant. This rare association can be due to coincidence, but we cannot exclude the possibility that the two conditions could share a common pathogenic mechanism. Although further research is needed to firmly establish a possible association, this case also highlights the necessity of exploring genetic backgrounds when patients present with clinical manifestations not readily explained by a single endocrine disorder. Investigating potential genetic associations is crucial since a positive genetic test allows for the testing of relatives, genetic counseling, and proper surveillance of individuals at risk.",39512978

A proto-oncogene mutation of the rearranged during transfection (<i>RET</i>) gene changes the way that receptor tyrosine kinases work. Multiple endocrine neoplasia, a pathological condition, involves these kinases. When the <i>RET</i> protooncogene changes, it can cause endocrine adenomas and hyperplasia to happen at the same time or one after the other. Pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and hyperparathyroidism, alone or in combination, are present in MEN2A patients. Some patients may also have skin lichen amyloidosis or Hirschsprung's disease. Patients with MEN2A often present with MTC. MTC is aggressive and has the worst prognosis, as most patients exhibit lymph node metastasis. MTC is one of the important causes of death in patients with MEN2A. RET mutation analysis aids in identifying MEN2A symptoms and monitoring levels of calcium, thyroid hormones, calcitonin, normetanephrine, fractionated metanephrines, and parathyroid hormone.

MEN2A also includes a 25% risk of developing parathyroid hyperplasia and is now recognised as four separate syndromes: classic MEN2A, MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, MEN2A with Hirschsprung's disease and familial MTC. MEN2B accounts for around 5% of all MEN2 cases and predisposes patients to diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis, mucosal neuromas and musculoskeletal abnormalities. MEN2 is autosomal dominantly inherited, meaning that several generations in a single family may be affected by the same syndrome. We present a mini review of four case studies (2 MEN2A and 2 MEN2B) that illustrate the advantages of RET testing, as well as some of the likely obstacles that must be overcome to receive a diagnosis of MEN2A or MEN2B. In addition, despite improved genotype/phenotype correlation in MEN2, we highlight that not all cases are 'typical', which emphasises the need for all MEN2 patients to be cared for in a centre of expertise and experience.

The single-celled symbionts have a worldwide distribution, including all continents and climate zones. The vast, largely undescribed, diversity of Trebouxia lineages is currently grouped into four phylogenetic clades (A, C, I, and S), based on a multilocus phylogeny. Genomes are still scarce, however, and it is unclear how the phylogenetic diversity, the broad ecological tolerances, and the ability to form symbioses with many different fungal host species are reflected in genome-wide differences. Here, we generated PacBio-based de novo genomes of six Trebouxia lineages belonging to the Clades A and S, isolated from lichen individuals of the genus Umbilicaria. Sequences belonging to Clade S have been reported in a previous study, but were reassembled and reanalyzed here. Genome sizes ranged between 63.08 and 73.88Mb. Repeat content accounted for 9% to 16% of the genome sequences. Based on RNA evidence, we predicted 14,109 to 16,701 gene models per genome, of which 5,203 belonged to a core set of gene families shared by all 6 lineages. Between 121 and 454, gene families are specific to each lineage. About 53% of the genes could be functionally annotated. The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (6 to 17 per genome) suggests that Trebouxia algae are able to synthesize alkaloids, saccharides, terpenes, NRPSs, and T3PKSs. Phylogenomic comparisons of the six strains indicate prevalent gene gain during Trebouxia evolution. Some of the gene families that exhibited significant evolutionary changes (i.e. gene expansion and contraction) are associated with metabolic processes linked to protein phosphorylation, which is known to have a role in photosynthesis regulation, particularly under changing light conditions.

Lichens are among the most sensitive organisms to climate change. Elevated ambient temperatures can have a significant impact on lichens, resulting in more frequent and intense drying events that can impede metabolic activity. It has been suggested that the possession of a diverse sterol composition may contribute to the tolerance of lichens to adverse temperatures and other biotic and abiotic stresses. The major sterol found in lichens is ergosterol (ERG); however, the regulation of the ERG biosynthetic pathway, specifically the step of epoxidation of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene catalyzed by squalene epoxidase during stress, has not been extensively studied. In this study, we used lichen <i>Lobaria pulmonaria</i> as a model species that is well known to be sensitive to air pollution and habitat loss. Using in silico analysis, we identified cDNAs encoding squalene epoxidase from <i>L. pulmonaria</i>, designating them as <i>LpSQE1</i> for the mycobiont and <i>SrSQE1</i> for the photobiont <i>Symbiochloris reticulata</i>. Our results showed that compared with a control kept at room temperature (+20 C), mild temperatures (+4 C and +30 C) did not affect the physiology of <i>L. pulmonaria</i>, assessed by changes in membrane integrity, respiration rates, and PSII activity. An extreme negative temperature (-20 C) noticeably inhibited respiration but did not affect membrane stability. In contrast, treating lichen with a high positive temperature (+40 C) significantly reduced all physiological parameters.

This study employs a two-way MR approach to investigate the potential causal relationships between diabetes type and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and the risk of OLP. We analyzed differentially expressed genes from the OLP dataset in the Genomics Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, cross-referencing these with HbA1c-related genes for enrichment analysis. Additionally, the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) were utilized to assess the effectiveness of specific drugs, herbs, and ingredients in treating OLP while managing blood glucose levels. The MR analysis revealed a significant association between Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and an increased risk of OLP, unlike Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

To date, widely distributed, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic pathways in LFF are not known. However, this idea stems from polyketide derivatives, since most biochemical research on lichens has concentrated on polyketide synthases (PKSs). Here, we present the first systematic identification and comparison of terpene biosynthetic genes of LFF using all the available Lecanoromycete reference genomes and 22 de novo sequenced ones (111 in total, representing 60 genera and 23 families). We implemented genome mining and gene networking approaches to identify and group the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) into networks of similar BGCs. Our large-scale analysis led to the identification of 724 terpene BGCs with varying degrees of pairwise similarity. Most BGCs in the dataset were unique with no similarity to a previously known fungal or bacterial BGC or among each other. Remarkably, we found two BGCs that were widely distributed in LFF. Interestingly, both conserved BGCs contain the same core gene, i.e., putatively a squalene/phytoene synthase (SQS), involved in sterol biosynthesis. This indicates that early gene duplications, followed by gene losses/gains and gene rearrangement are the major evolutionary factors shaping the composition of these widely distributed SQS BGCs across LFF.

Usnic acid, a secondary metabolite of lichen, has been identified as a drug candidate molecule in cancer treatment. The determination of miRNA target proteins is essential for the understanding of molecular mechanisms of miRNA-related tumorigenesis. We determined that mir-185-5p has therapeutic potential at the miRNA level by applying usnic acid to BT-474 breast cancer cells in a previous study. Herein, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of miR-185-5p on BT-474 breast cancer cells using a proteomics approach. We explored the changes in the protein expression level of BT-474 breast cancer cells in response to the up-regulation of miR-185-5p after applying usnic acid as a novel candidate anti-- cancer drug molecule.

This study is the first to explore the effects of UV-B on gene expression in lichens to predict metabolic pathways involved in tolerance. Using transcriptome profiling and bioinformatic analyses, here we studied the effects of UV-B on gene expression in lichens using Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoff. as a model species. UV-B exposure causes significant browning of the upper cortex of the thallus, which correlates to an increased expression of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the synthesis of eu- and allomelanins and melanin precursors. Based on transcriptome analyses, we suggest that the biosynthesis of melanins and other secondary metabolites, such as naphthalene derivates, tropolones, anthraquinones, and xanthones, is a trade-off that lichens pay to protect essential metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. Expression profiles of general stress-associated genes, in particular, related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, protection of proteins, and DNA repair, clearly indicate that the mycobiont is the more UV-B-responsive and susceptible partner in lichen symbiosis.

Samples were subjected to p53 IHC and DNA methylation analysis of a 3-gene marker panel containing ZNF582, SST, and miR124-2. Methylation levels and p53 IHC status (mutant or wild-type) were assessed and compared among all disease categories. Odds ratios were determined to identify whether the biomarkers were associated with progression to cancer in patients with LS. The highest methylation levels were found in HPVi VIN and VSCC, followed by LS and healthy vulvar controls. The largest heterogeneity in methylation levels was observed in LS cases. In fact, the 3-marker panel tested positive in 70% of LS, which progressed to VSCC vs only 17% of LS in patients without cancer development (P= .002). Also, mutant p53 IHC was observed more frequently in LS with progression to VSCC compared with nonprogressive LS cases (42% vs 3%, respectively, P=.001). Multivariable analysis identified a mutant p53 status as the only independent risk factor for cancer development in LS (odds ratio: 34.0, 95% CI: 1.4-807.4). In conclusion, DNA methylation testing and p53 IHC show strong potential as prognostic biomarkers for the identification of LS patients at high risk of progression to cancer.",38925253

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an interferon gamma (INF) inducing agent. It is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that was found to play a role in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune disorders. This study included 50 patients with classic cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) and 50 healthy volunteers serving as controls. Venous blood samples were withdrawn from the study subjects under complete aseptic precautions. Blood samples were examined for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-18 gene at promoter -137(G/C) and -656 (G/T) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IL-18 level was assessed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean level of IL-18 was significantly higher in CLP patients (31.634.90) compared to control subjects (13.956.82). Significantly high levels of IL-18 were found among patients with diabetes, hypertension (p<0.01 in both). HCV positive patients and patients with both OLP and CLP also expressed higher levels of IL-18. Genotypic and allelic distribution at position -137(G/C) showed that the genotype GG was present at significantly higher frequency in cases (58%) compared to controls (28.0%). On the other hand the CC genotype at position -137 was significantly higher in the controls (28%) as compared to CLP cases (6%). Polymorphism of IL-18 at position -656(G/T) showed no significant difference between cases and controls. No significant difference could be detected in IL-18 level between different genotypic variants at position -137(G/C) and -656(G/T). IL-18 may play important role in pathogenesis of LP. Elevated IL-18 levels could be part of the pro-inflammatory autoimmune process in LP. The presence of OLP, HCV, diabetes and hypertension is associated with higher production of IL-18. IL-18 promotor region -137(G/C) polymorphism might be a factor that increase the risk of development of lichen planus in Egyptian patients.",38918874

We examine the physiological, ecological, and transcriptional basis of this asymmetry in the lichen <i>Evernia mesomorpha</i>. This carbon balance asymmetry depends on hydration source and aligns with climatic range limits. Differences in gene expression across the <i>E. mesomorpha</i> symbiosis suggest that the physiologies of the primary lichen symbionts are decoupled.

An earlier genome-wide meta-analysis of female FFA identified risk loci in genes implicated in self-antigen presentation and T-cell homeostasis, including HLA-B*07:02, ST3GAL1, and SEMA4B. However, CYP1B1, which is important for hormone metabolism, was also implicated with the substitution of serine for asparagine at position 453 (c.1358A>G, p.Asn453Ser) exhibiting a protective effect against FFA. Increasing understanding of genetic and environmental variables and their interactions will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and has the potential to inform risk mitigation strategies. To investigate whether oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use modulates the protective effect of the common missense variant in CYP1B1 (c.1358A>G, p.Asn453Ser) on FFA risk. This gene-environment interaction study using a case-control design enrolled female patients with FFA from UK-based dermatology clinics. The patients were matched with unrelated age- and ancestry-matched female control individuals derived from UK Biobank in a 1:66 ratio, determined by the first 4 principal components from genome-wide genotypes. Data were collected from July 2015 to September 2017, and analyzed from October 2022 to December 2023. The main outcomes were the modulatory effect of OCP use on the contribution of the CYP1B1 missense variant to female FFA risk and a formal gene-environment interaction test evaluated by a logistic regression model with a multiplicative interaction term, under the assumptions of an additive genetic model interaction term, under the assumptions of an additive genetic model. Of the 489 female patients with FFA, the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (9.7) years, and 370 (75.7%) had a history of OCP use. Of the 34254 age- and ancestry-matched control individuals, the mean (SD) age was 65.0 (8.4) years, and previous OCP use was reported in 31177 (91.0%). An association between female FFA and the CYP1B1 risk allele was observed in individuals who reported OCP use (odds ratio, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.50-2.40]; P=8.4110-8) but not in those with no documented exposure to OCPs (odds ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.82-1.64]; P=.39). A full gene-environment interaction model demonstrated a significant additive statistical interaction between c.1358A, p.453Asn, and history of OCP use on FFA risk (OR for interaction, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.07-2.46]; P=.02). This gene-environment interaction analysis suggests that the protective effect of the CYP1B1 missense variant on FFA risk might be mediated by exposure to OCPs.

We then perform ancestral state reconstruction and comparative phylogenomics. We identify at least three independent gains of the ability to engage in the lichen symbiosis, one in Trebouxiophyceae and two in Ulvophyceae, confirming the convergent evolution of the lichen symbioses. A carbohydrate-active enzyme from the glycoside hydrolase 8 (GH8) family was identified as a top candidate for the molecular-mechanism underlying lichen symbiosis in Trebouxiophyceae. This GH8 was acquired in lichenizing Trebouxiophyceae by horizontal gene transfer, concomitantly with the ability to associate with lichens fungal symbionts (LFS) and is able to degrade polysaccharides found in the cell wall of LFS.

The results of knockout transgenic experiments showed that OsLSC6 regulated the biosynthesis and accumulation of sd1825, controlled the purple leaf sheath. Our further research revealed that OsLSC6 also confers resistance to cold stress during the seedling stage in rice. And we identified that a SNP in OsLSC6 was responsible for the leaf sheath color and chilling tolerance, supporting the importance of OsLSC6 in plant adaption.

"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Development of an immune-related diagnostic predictive model for oral lichen planus.,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) was a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology with a 1.4% chance of progressing to malignancy. However, it has been suggested in several studies that immune system disorders played a dominant role in the onset and progression of OLP. Therefore, this experiment aimed to develop a diagnostic prediction model for OLP based on immunopathogenesis to achieve early diagnosis and treatment and prevent cancer. In this study, 2 publicly available OLP datasets from the gene expression omnibus database were filtered. In the experimental group (GSE52130), the level of immune cell infiltration was assessed using MCPcounter and ssGSEA algorithms. Subsequently, differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed between the OLP and control groups. The resulting differentially expressed genes were intersected with immunologically relevant genes provided on the immunology database and analysis portal database (ImmPort) website to obtain differentially expressed immunologically relevant genes (DEIRGs). Furthermore, the gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses were carried out. Finally, protein-protein interaction network and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses constructed a model for OLP. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the experimental and validation datasets (GSE38616) were plotted separately to validate the model's credibility. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR experiment was performed to verify the expression level of the diagnostic genes. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed a more significant degree of inflammatory infiltration in the OLP group compared to the control group. In addition, the gene set enrichment analysis results were mainly associated with keratinization, antibacterial and immune responses, etc. A total of 774 differentially expressed genes was obtained according to the screening criteria, of which 65 were differentially expressed immunologically relevant genes. Ultimately, an immune-related diagnostic prediction model for OLP, which was composed of 5 hub genes (BST2, RNASEL, PI3, DEFB4A, CX3CL1), was identified. The verification results showed that the model has good diagnostic ability. There was a significant correlation between the 5 hub diagnostic biomarkers and immune infiltrating cells. The development of this model gave a novel insight into the early diagnosis of OLP.",38489725

Lichen samples belonging to the Umbilicariaceae family, commonly known as rock tripe lichens, were gathered from two distinct alpine fellfields: one situated on Mt. Brennkogel located in the Eastern European Alps (Austria), and the other on Mt. Stanley located in the Rwenzori mountains of equatorial Africa (Uganda). The primary aim of this research was to undertake a comparative investigation into the bacterial compositions, and diversities, identifying potential indicators and exploring their potential metabolisms, of these lichen samples. Bulk genomic DNA was extracted from the lichen samples, which was used to amplify the 18S rRNA gene by Sanger sequencing and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene by Illumina Miseq sequencing. Examination of the fungal partner was carried out through the analysis of 18S rRNA gene sequences, belonging to the genus Umbilicaria (Ascomycota), and the algal partner affiliated with the lineage Trebouxia (Chlorophyta), constituted the symbiotic components. Analyzing the MiSeq datasets by using bioinformatics methods, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were established based on a predetermined similarity threshold for the V3-V4 sequences, which were assigned to a total of 26 bacterial phyla that were found in both areas. Eight of the 26 phyla, i.e. Acidobacteriota, Actinomycota, Armatimonadota, Bacteroidota, Chloroflexota, Deinococcota, Planctomycetota, and Pseudomonadota, were consistently present in all samples, each accounting for more than 1% of the total read count. Distinct differences in bacterial composition emerged between lichen samples from Austria and Uganda, with the OTU frequency-based regional indicator phyla, Pseudomonadota and Armatimonadota, respectively. Despite the considerable geographic separation of approximately 5430km between the two regions, the prediction of potential metabolic pathways based on OTU analysis revealed similar relative abundances.

Tissue samples from OED and OLP cases were analyzed using immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry (IF/IHC) for CD4, CD8, CD163/STAT1, and PD-1/PDL-1 expression. RNA-sequencing was performed on the samples, and data was subjected to CIBERSORTx analysis for immune cell composition. Gene Ontology analysis on the immune differentially expressed genes was also conducted. In OED, CD8+T-cells infiltrated dysplastic epithelium, correlating with dysplasia severity. CD4+lymphocytes increased in the basal layer. STAT1/CD163+macrophages correlated with CD4+intraepithelial distribution. PD-1/PDL-1 expression varied. IF/IHC analysis revealed differential immune cell composition between OED and OLP. RNA-sequencing identified upregulated genes associated with cytotoxic response and immunosurveillance in OED. Downregulated genes were linked to signaling, immune cell recruitment, and tumor suppression. The immune microenvironment distinguishes OED and OLP, suggesting diagnostic potential. Upregulated genes indicate cytotoxic immune response in OED. Downregulation of TRADD, CX3CL1, and ILI24 implies dysregulation in TNFR1 signaling, immune recruitment, and tumor suppression.

The miR-99a involve in growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Therefore, we evaluated miR-99a expression in serum of OSCC and erosive atrophic OLP patients in comparison to healthy control individuals to more investigate about level of miR-99a expression in potential premalignant disorder (erosive atrophic OLP) in comparison to malignant transformation form (OSCC). Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses were performed to better understand the importance of miR-99a in OSCC. In this cross-sectional study, total 90 serum samples from OSCC patients (n = 30), erosive atrophic OLP (n = 30) and healthy control individuals (n = 30) were collected, and then evaluated for miR-99a expression by qPCR. Pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction were done using STRING (v: 12.0), and (GO) terms and related genes were extracted from the GO online search tool. The statistical analysis was evaluated by Kruskal Wallis, Chi-Square, Kruskal Wallis, Spearman and Mann-Whitney tests. The p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. miR-99a expression down regulated in OSCC in comparison to erosive atrophic OLP and control groups (p < 0.05).

Achieving early diagnosis and effective therapy planning requires the identification of reliable diagnostic biomarkers for these disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently received attention as powerful biomarkers for various illnesses, including cancer.

The downregulated genes among the DEGs were subsequently imported into the miRWalk database to search for potential target genes of miRNA 483-5p that lacked validation. To gain insight into the biological pathways associated with the DEGs, we conducted pathway analysis utilizing tools, such as Enrichr. Additionally, the cellular components associated with these DEGs were investigated by analyzing the String database.

Moreover, this study explored the prognostic value of miR-483-5p through its association with clinicopathological parameters in OSCC patients. The results showed that serum expression of miR-483-5p was considerably higher in OSCC patients compared to OLP patients and healthy controls (p 0.0001) and that this difference was statistically significant. Furthermore, elevated miR-483-5p expression was associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and stage of tumor nodal metastasis in OSCC patients (p 0.001, p 0.038, and p 0.0001, respectively). <i>In silico</i> analysis found 71 upregulated genes at the intersection of upregulated DEGs and 44 downregulated genes at the intersection of downregulated DEGs, offering insight into the potential underlying mechanisms of miR-483-5p's engagement in OSCC and OLP.

Most of these DEGs were located in the extracellular region. After screening for downregulated genes that were invalidated, miRNA 483-5p had 7 target genes. This study demonstrates the potential of serum miR-483-5p as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in OSCC and OLP patients. Its upregulation in OSCC patients and its association with advanced tumor stage and potential metastasis suggest the involvement of miR-483-5p in critical signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation, making it a reliable indicator of disease progression.

This study is aimed at investigating whether diffractaic acid (DA), one of the secondary metabolites of lichen, exhibits a potential anticancer effect on HepG2 cells and whether its anticancer effect is mediated by inhibition of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRXR1), which is a target of chemotherapeutic strategies due to overexpression in tumor cells including HCC. XTT assay results showed that DA exhibited strong cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 78.07g/mL at 48h. Flow cytometric analysis results revealed that DA displayed late apoptotic and necrotic effects on HepG2 cells. Consistent with these findings, real-time PCR results showed that DA did not alter the BAX/BCL2 ratio in HepG2 cells but upregulated the P53 gene. Moreover, the wound healing assay results revealed a strong anti-migratory effect of DA in HepG2 cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated that DA increased TRXR1 gene and protein expression levels, whereas enzyme activity studies disclosed that DA inhibited TRXR1.

"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Interfering with the AKT/mTOR/STAT3/ID1 signaling axis with usenamine A restrains the proliferative and invasive potential of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"Usenamine A, a novel natural compound initially isolated from the lichen Usnea longissima, has exhibited promising efficacy against hepatoma in prior investigation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for its antihepatoma effects remain unclear. Furthermore, the role of the AKT/mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 1 (ID1) signaling axis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the potential anti-HCC effects of drugs targeting this pathway are not well understood. CCK-8 assay was used to investigate the effects of usenamine A on the proliferation of human HCC cells. Moreover, the effects of usenamine A on the invasion ability of human HCC cells were evaluated by transwell assay. In addition, expression profiling analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, RNAi, immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were used to explore the effects of usenamine A on the newly identified AKT/mTOR/STAT3/ID1 signaling axis in human HCC cells. Usenamine A inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human HCC cell lines (HepG2 and SK-HEP-1). Through the analysis of gene expression profiling, we identified that usenamine A suppressed the expression of ID1 in human HCC cells. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that usenamine A facilitated the degradation of the ID1 protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, usenamine A inhibited the activity of STAT3 in human HCC cells. ChIP analysis demonstrated that STAT3 positively regulated ID1 expression at the transcriptional level in human HCC cells. The STAT3/ID1 axis played a role in mediating the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive impacts of usenamine A on human HCC cells. Additionally, usenamine A suppressed the STAT3/ID1 axis through AKT/mTOR signaling in human HCC cells. Usenamine A displayed robust anti-HCC potential, partly attributed to its capacity to downregulate the AKT/mTOR/STAT3/ID1 signaling pathway and promote ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated ID1 degradation. Usenamine A has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for HCC cases characterized by abnormal AKT/mTOR/STAT3/ID1 signaling, and targeting the AKT/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway may be a viable option for treating patients with HCC exhibiting elevated ID1 expression.",38183094

Here, we hypothesize that lichenizing fungi occupying different climate zones tune their metabolism to local environmental conditions with the help of their circadian systems. We study two species of the genus Umbilicaria occupying similar climatic niches (Mediterranean and the cold temperate) in different continents. Using homology to Neurospora crassa genes, we identify gene sets associated with circadian rhythms (11 core, 39 peripheral genes) as well as temperature response (37 genes). Nucleotide diversity of these genes is significantly correlated with mean annual temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter. Furthermore, we identify altitudinal clines in allele frequencies in several non-synonymous substitutions in core clock components, for example, white collar-like, frh-like and various ccg-like genes. A dN/dS approach revealed a few significant peripheral clock- and temperature-associated genes (e.g. ras-1-like, gna-1-like) that may play a role in fine-tuning the circadian clock and temperature-response machinery. An analysis of allele frequency changes demonstrated the strongest evidence for differentiation above the genomic background in the clock-associated genes in U.pustulata. These results highlight the likely relevance of the circadian clock in environmental adaptation, particularly frost tolerance, of lichens.

To identify effective microbial strains, we isolated and characterized 81 halophilic bacteria from various sources, such as plants, rhizosphere, algae, lichen, sea sediments, and sea water. We screened these bacterial strains for their plant growth-promoting activities, such as indole acetic acid (IAA), phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production.

"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",Tridepsides as potential bioactives: a review on their chemistry and the global distribution of their lichenic and non-lichenic natural sources.,"Tridepsides, as fully oxidized polyketides, have been known to exist in lichens for more than a century. Recent studies have showed that these possible defensive lichenochemicals possess various biological activities. Also, a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster was recently reported for gyrophoric acid (GA), an important tridepside. The present study focused on biosynthesis, natural sources, biological activities, and bioanalytical methods of tridepside molecules. Our survey shows that, so far, lichenic tridepsides have been reported from 37 families, 111 genera, and 526 species of lichen. Because many of their species contain tridepsides, the families Parmeliaceae, Lobariaceae, and Peltigeraceae can be considered critical lichenic sources of tridepsides. Furthermore, several species of <i>Hypotrachyna</i> in Parmeliaceae family showed lichenic tridepsides, suggesting that this genus is a viable source of tridepsides. This research also explored tridepsides from non-lichenic sources, such as non-lichenized fungi, lichenicolous fungi, endophytes, parasites, and liverworts, which offer substantial potential as biotechnological sources to produce tridepsides, which are produced in small amounts in lichen thalli. Two lichenic tridepsides have also been detected in non-lichenic sources: GA and tenuiorin (TE). Additionally, no significant correlation was found between tridepside biosynthesis and geographical distribution patterns for several potentially tridepside-producing lichens. We further showed that GA is the most studied tridepside with various reported biological activities, including anticancer, wound healing, photoprotection, anti-aging, antioxidant, cardiovascular effect, DNA interaction, anti-diabetes, anti-Alzheimer's, anti-bacterial, and antifungal. Last but not least, this study provides an overview of some bioanalytical methods used to analyze tridepsides over the past few years.",37746133
"""lichen"" AND ""gene""",The Sordariomycetes: an expanding resource with Big Data for mining in evolutionary genomics and transcriptomics.,"Advances in genomics and transcriptomics accompanying the rapid accumulation of omics data have provided new tools that have transformed and expanded the traditional concepts of model fungi. Evolutionary genomics and transcriptomics have flourished with the use of classical and newer fungal models that facilitate the study of diverse topics encompassing fungal biology and development. Technological advances have also created the opportunity to obtain and mine large datasets. One such continuously growing dataset is that of the Sordariomycetes, which exhibit a richness of species, ecological diversity, economic importance, and a profound research history on amenable models. Currently, 3,574 species of this class have been sequenced, comprising nearly one-third of the available ascomycete genomes. Among these genomes, multiple representatives of the model genera <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Neurospora</i>, and <i>Trichoderma</i> are present. In this review, we examine recently published studies and data on the Sordariomycetes that have contributed novel insights to the field of fungal evolution <i>via</i> integrative analyses of the genetic, pathogenic, and other biological characteristics of the fungi. Some of these studies applied ancestral state analysis of gene expression among divergent lineages to infer regulatory network models, identify key genetic elements in fungal sexual development, and investigate the regulation of conidial germination and secondary metabolism. Such multispecies investigations address challenges in the study of fungal evolutionary genomics derived from studies that are often based on limited model genomes and that primarily focus on the aspects of biology driven by knowledge drawn from a few model species. Rapidly accumulating information and expanding capabilities for systems biological analysis of Big Data are setting the stage for the expansion of the concept of model systems from unitary taxonomic species/genera to inclusive clusters of well-studied models that can facilitate both the in-depth study of specific lineages and also investigation of trait diversity across lineages. The Sordariomycetes class, in particular, offers abundant omics data and a large and active global research community. As such, the Sordariomycetes can form a core omics clade, providing a blueprint for the expansion of our knowledge of evolution at the genomic scale in the exciting era of Big Data and artificial intelligence, and serving as a reference for the future analysis of different taxonomic levels within the fungal kingdom.",37746130

Despite their ecological importance virtually no research has been conducted on the genomics of A. socialis. To address this, we used long-read sequencing to generate the first high-quality draft genome of A. socialis. Lichen thallus tissue was collected from Pinkham Canyon in Joshua Tree National Park, California and deposited in the UC Riverside herbarium under accession #295874.

The BUSCO completeness score of the assembled genome was 97.5% using the Ascomycota gene set. Information on the genome of A. socialis is important for California conservation purposes given that this lichen is threatened in some places locally by wildfires due to climate change. This reference genome will be used for understanding the genetic diversity, population genomics, and comparative genomics of A. socialis species.

Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is often overexpressed in many cancer cells, and targeting TrxR1 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. This study investigated the anticancer impacts of diffractaic and vulpinic acids, lichen secondary metabolites, on the cervical cancer HeLa cell line. XTT findings demonstrated showed that diffractaic and vulpinic acids suppressed the proliferation of HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and IC<sub>50</sub> values were 22.52g/ml and 66.53g/ml at 48h, respectively. Each of these lichen metabolites significantly suppressed migration. Diffractaic acid showed an increase in both the BAX/BCL2 ratio by qPCR analysis and the apoptotic cell population via flow cytometry analysis on HeLa cells. Concerning vulpinic acid, although it decreased the BAX/BCL2 ratio in this cells, it increased apoptotic cells according to the flow cytometry analysis results. Diffractaic and vulpinic acids significantly suppressed TrxR1 enzyme activity rather than the gene and protein expression levels in HeLa cells.

An investigation of <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i>'s mechanism of action for treating OLP was conducted, and a theoretical basis was provided for improving current treatment regimens. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We used a network pharmacological approach to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i> in the treatment of OLP. Then, potential protein targets between <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i> and OLP were analyzed through a drug-target network. This was followed by KEGG enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) classification. Finally, for molecular docking, AutoDock Vina was used. <i>Results</i>: A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by analyzing the common targets of a total of 51 wilfordii-OLP interactions from different databases. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the treatment of OLP with <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i> mainly involves lipopolysaccharide response, bacterial molecular response, positive regulation of cytokine production, and leukocyte proliferation, and the signaling pathways mainly include the AGE-RAGE, NF-B, Toll-like receptor, IL-17, HIF-1, and TNF signaling pathways. The molecular docking results showed that -sitosterol, kaempferol, hederagenin, and triptolide have a higher affinity for AKT1, TNF, CASP3, and PTGS2, respectively. Based on the CytoNCA analysis of common targets, 19 key targets, including AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, STAT3, CXCL8, PTGS2, TP53, and CASP3, and their connections were identified. <i>Conclusions</i>: Preliminarily, this study reveals that <i>Tripterygium wilfordii</i> interferes with OLP by interacting with multiple targets through multiple accesses, as validated by molecular docking.",37629739

Women diagnosed with LS (n=16) and matched controls (n=14) were enrolled in the study. From each participant, midstream urine, upper and lower vaginal swabs, as well as faecal samples, were collected. The microbiota composition was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region.

However, for unweighted UniFrac, significant differences in the urinary and lower vaginal microbiota were observed when comparing women with LS to controls. These findings indicate that while the two groups have microbiota dominated by the same bacteria, variations do occur amongst less abundant bacteria. The LEfSe analysis revealed a higher relative abundance of the genus Streptococcus in the urinary and lower vaginal microbiota in women with LS compared to controls. Additionally, a higher relative abundance of phylum Euryarchaeota was observed in the gut microbiota in women with LS compared to controls.

However, despite the extensive studies on production of lichen secondary metabolites, little is known about the responsible biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Here, we identified a putative BGC that is implicated in production of a red pigment, cristazarin (a naphthazarin derivative), in Cladonia metacorallifera. Previously, cristazarin was shown to be specifically induced in growth media containing fructose as a sole carbon source. Thus, we performed transcriptome analysis of C. metacorallifera growing on different carbon sources including fructose to identify the BGC for cristazarin. Among 39 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes found in the genome of C. metacorallifera, a non-reducing PKS (coined crz7) was highly expressed in growth media containing either fructose or glucose. The borders of a cristazarin gene cluster were delimited by co-expression patterns of neighboring genes of the crz7. BGCs highly conserved to the cristazarin BGC were also found in C. borealis and C. macilenta, indicating that these related species also have metabolic potentials to produce cristazarin. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Crz7 is sister to fungal PKSs that biosynthesize an acetylated tetrahydoxynaphthalene as a precursor of melanin pigment. Based on the phylogenetic placement of the Crz7 and putative functions of its neighboring genes, we proposed a plausible biosynthetic route for cristazarin.

A dated phylogeny describes the time frame in which extant disjunctions of species and populations were established. The results showed that the genus is integrated by four species, with Lichina pygmaea, L. confinis and the newly described L. canariensis from rocky seashores in the Canary Islands, occurring in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas L. intermedia is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere. Lichina intermedia hosted a much higher intraspecific genetic diversity than the other species, with subclades interpreted as species-level lineages by the different species delimitation approaches. However, a conservative taxonomic approach was adopted. This species showed a striking disjunct distribution between Australasia and southern South America. The timing for the observed interspecific and intraspecific divergences and population disjunctions postdated continental plate movements, suggesting that long-distance dispersal across body waters in the two hemispheres played a major role in shaping the current species distributions. Such ocean crossings were, as in L. canariensis, followed by speciation. New substitution rates for the nrITS of the genus Lichina were inferred using a tree spanning the major Ascomycota lineages calibrated using fossils.

At the same time, a series of protective transcripts/proteins, such as those related to antioxidant defence, polyol metabolism and autophagy, was upregulated during dehydration. Overall, our results show a transient decrease in most cellular functions as a result of drying and a gradual reactivation of specific cell processes to accommodate the hydration status along successive D/R cycles.

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. Here the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is used to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter genes showed significant upregulation. Further, transcriptomes from N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata were analysed to reveal stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected N. vectensis to heat stress and measured the transcription dynamics of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30min, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis.

Single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within seven cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell clusters containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and lipid metabolism genes than aposymbiotic gastrodermal cells. Furthermore, differential enrichment of immune system gene pathways and lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation were observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, there were no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster between symbiotic states. We conclude that there is evidence for compartmentalization of immune system regulation in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis.

Adult corals rely on a vital nutritional exchange with their symbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae), but the dynamics of reliance from fertilization to recruitment are understudied. We investigated the physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic changes across 13 developmental stages of Montipora capitata, a coral in Hawai'i that inherits symbionts from parent to egg. We found that embryonic development depends on maternally provisioned mRNAs and lipids, with a rapid shift to symbiont-derived nutrition in late developmental stages. Symbiont density and photosynthesis peak in swimming larvae to fuel pelagic dispersal. By contrast, respiratory demand increases significantly during metamorphosis and settlement, reflecting this energy-intensive morphological reorganization. Symbiont proliferation is driven by symbiont ammonium assimilation in larval stages with little evidence of nitrogen metabolism in the coral host. As development progresses, the host enhances nitrogen sequestration, regulating symbiont populations, and ensuring the transfer of fixed carbon to support metamorphosis, with both metabolomic and transcriptomic indicators of increased carbohydrate availability. Although algal symbiont community composition remained stable, bacterial communities shifted with ontogeny, associated with holobiont metabolic reorganization. Our study reveals extensive metabolic changes during development with increasing reliance on symbiont nutrition. Metamorphosis and settlement emerge as critical periods of energetic vulnerability to projected climate scenarios that destabilize symbiosis.

Symbiosis with either eukaryotic symbiont resulted in differential geneexpression and metabolic abundance for diverse processes spanning metabolism and immunity to reproduction and development, with some of these processes being unique to either symbiont.

In a 2-month manipulative experiment, we exposed the coral Porites lutea to gradually increasing temperatures corresponding to 0-8 degree heating weeks (DHW) and assessed the response of the coral holobiont using coral and Symbiodiniaceae transcriptomics, microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological measurements. From early stages of heat stress (<1 DHW), the increase in metabolic turnover shifted the holobiont to a net heterotrophic state in which algal-derived nutrients were insufficient to meet host energy demands, resulting in reduced holobiont performance at 1 DHW. We postulate the altered nutrient cycling also affected the coral-associated microbial community, with the relative abundance of Endozoicomonas bacteria declining under increasing heat stress. Integration of holobiont stress responses correlated this decline to an increase in expression of a host ADP-ribosylation factor, suggesting that Symbiodiniaceae and Endozoicomonas may underlie similar endosymbiotic regulatory processes. The thermotolerance of coral holobionts therefore is influenced by the nutritional status of its members and their interactions, and this identified metabolic interdependency highlights the importance of applying an integrative approach to guide coral reef conservation efforts.

As important as this relationship is for maintaining healthy reefs, it is strikingly delicate. When ocean temperatures briefly exceed the average summer maximum, corals can bleach, losing their endosymbionts. Although the mechanisms governing bleaching are unknown, studies implicate uncoupling of coral and algal cell divisions at high temperatures. Still, little is known regarding the coordination of host and algal cell divisions. Control of nutrient exchange is one likely mechanism. Both nitrogen and phosphate are necessary for dividing cells, and although nitrogen enrichment is known to increase symbiont density in the host, the consequences of phosphate enrichment are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of phosphate depletion on symbiont growth in culture and compared the physiology of phosphate-starved symbionts in culture to symbionts that were freshly isolated from a host. We found that available phosphate is as low in freshly isolated symbionts as it is in phosphate-starved cultures. Furthermore, RNAseq revealed that phosphate-limited and freshly isolated symbionts have similar patterns of gene expression for phosphate-dependent genes, most notably upregulation of phosphatases, which is consistent with phosphate recycling. Similarly, lipid profiling revealed a substantial decrease in phospholipid abundance in both phosphate-starved cultures and freshly isolated symbionts. These findings are important because they suggest that limited access to phosphate controls algal cell divisions within a host. The corals responsible for building tropical reefs are disappearing at an alarming rate as elevated sea temperatures cause them to bleach and lose the algal symbionts they rely on. Without these symbionts, corals are unable to harvest energy from sunlight and, therefore, struggle to thrive or even survive in the nutrient-poor waters of the tropics. To devise solutions to address the threat to coral reefs, it is necessary to understand the cellular events underpinning the bleaching process. One model for bleaching proposes that heat stress impairs algal photosynthesis and transfer of sugar to the host. Consequently, the host's demands for nitrogen decrease, increasing nitrogen availability to the symbionts, which leads to an increase in algal proliferation that overwhelms the host. Our work suggests that phosphate may play a similar role to nitrogen in this feedback loop.",39105583

The diversity of the eukaryotic 18S rDNA phylogenetic gene marker has helped to identify some of these symbiotic haptophyte species, yet we still lack a genetic marker to assess its diversity at a finer scale. One of such genes is the ammonium transporter (<i>amt</i>) gene, which encodes the protein that might be involved in the uptake of ammonium from UCYN-A in these symbiotic haptophytes. Here, we designed three specific PCR primer sets targeting the <i>amt</i> gene of the haptophyte species (A1-Host) symbiotic with the open ocean UCYN-A1 sublineage, and tested them in samples collected from open ocean and near-shore environments. Regardless of the primer pair used at Station ALOHA, which is where UCYN-A1 is the pre-dominant UCYN-A sublineage, the most abundant <i>amt</i> amplicon sequence variant (ASV) was taxonomically classified as A1-Host. In addition, two out of the three PCR primer sets revealed the existence of closely-related divergent haptophyte <i>amt</i> ASVs (>95% nucleotide identity).

Corals can acquire photosynthates from Symbiodiniaceae, whilst Symbiodiniaceae uses metabolites from corals. Prokaryotic microbes provide Symbiodiniaceae with nutrients and support the resilience of corals as meta-organisms. Eutrophication is a major cause of coral reef degradation; however, its effects on the transcriptomic response of coral meta-organisms remain unclear, particularly for prokaryotic microbes associated with corals in the larval stage. To understandacclimation of the coral meta-organism to elevated nitrate conditions,we analyzed the physiological and transcriptomic responses of Pocillopora damicornis larvae, an ecologically important scleractinian coral, after 5days of exposure to elevated nitrate levels (5, 10, 20, and 40M). The major differentially expressed transcripts in coral, Symbiodiniaceae, and prokaryotic microbes included thoserelated to development, stress response, and transport. The development of Symbiodiniaceae was not affected in the 5 and 20M groups but was downregulated in the 10 and 40M groups. In contrast, prokaryotic microbe development was upregulated in the 10 and 40M groups and downregulated in the 5 and 20M groups. Meanwhile, coral larval development was less downregulated in the 10 and 40M groups than in the 5 and 20M groups. In addition, multiple larval, Symbiodiniaceae, and prokaryotic transcripts were significantly correlated with each other. The core transcripts in correlation networks were related to development, nutrient metabolism, and transport. A generalized linear mixed model, using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, demonstrated that the Symbiodiniaceae could both benefit and cost coral larval development. Furthermore, the most significantly correlated prokaryotic transcripts maintained negative correlations with the physiological functions of Symbiodiniaceae. Results suggested that Symbiodiniaceae tended to retain more nutrients under elevated nitrate concentrations, thereby shifting the coral-algal association from mutualism towards parasitism.

But how glucose is transferred from the algal symbiont to the animal host is unknown. We reasoned that a transporter resident in the dinoflagellate cell membrane would facilitate outward transfer of glucose to the surrounding host animal tissue. We identified a candidate transporter in the cnidarian symbiont dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum that belongs to the ubiquitous family of facilitative sugar uniporters known as SWEETs (sugars will eventually be exported transporters). Previous gene expression analyses had shown that BmSWEET1 is upregulated when the algae are living symbiotically in a cnidarian host by comparison to the free-living state [1, 2]. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to localise BmSWEET1 in the dinoflagellate cell membrane. Substrate preference assays in a yeast surrogate transport system showed that BmSWEET1 transports glucose. Quantitative microscopy showed that symbiotic B. minutum cells have significantly more BmSWEET1 protein than free-living cells of the same strain, consistent with export during symbiosis but not during the free-living, planktonic phase. Thus, BmSWEET1 is in the right place, at the right time, and has the right substrate to be the transporter with which symbiotic dinoflagellate algae feed their animal hosts to power coral reefs.",36709382

Here, we use the mesophotic coral <i>Euphyllia paradivisa</i> to examine temporal gene expression patterns in symbiotic and aposymbiotic morphs exposed to natural light/dark cycles and constant darkness. Our comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed circadian and circatidal cycles of gene expression with a predominant diel pattern in both coral morphs.

Symbiotic species of Symbiodiniaceae have two distinct life stages: inside the host, <i>in hospite</i>, and outside the host, <i>ex hospite</i>. Several aspects of cnidarian-algal symbiosis can be understood by comparing these two life stages. Most commonly, algae in culture are used in comparative studies to represent the <i>ex hospite</i> life stage, however, nutrition becomes a confounding variable for this comparison because algal culture media is nutrient rich, while algae <i>in hospite</i> are sampled from hosts maintained in oligotrophic seawater. In contrast to cultured algae, expelled algae may be a more robust representation of the <i>ex hospite</i> state, as the host and expelled algae are in the same seawater environment, removing differences in culture media as a confounding variable. Here, we studied the physiology of algae released from the sea anemone <i>Exaiptasia diaphana</i> (commonly called Aiptasia), a model system for the study of coral-algal symbiosis. In Aiptasia, algae are released in distinct pellets, referred to as egesta, and we explored its potential as an experimental system to represent Symbiodiniaceae in the <i>ex hospite</i> state. Observation under confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy revealed that egesta contained discharged nematocysts, host tissue, and were populated by a diversity of microbes, including protists and cyanobacteria. Further experiments revealed that egesta were released at night. In addition, algae in egesta had a higher mitotic index than algae <i>in hospite</i>, were photosynthetically viable for at least 48 hrs after expulsion, and could competently establish symbiosis with aposymbiotic Aiptasia. We then studied the gene expression of nutrient-related genes and studied their expression using qPCR. From the genes tested, we found that algae from egesta closely mirrored gene expression profiles of algae <i>in hospite</i> and were dissimilar to those of cultured algae, suggesting that algae from egesta are in a nutritional environment that is similar to their <i>in hospite</i> counterparts. Altogether, evidence is provided that algae from Aiptasia egesta are a robust representation of Symbiodiniaceae in the <i>ex hospite</i> state and their use in experiments can improve our understanding of cnidarian-algal symbiosis.",35923894

When becoming symbionts, Symbiodiniaceae cells show a reduced proliferation rate and a different life history. While it is generally believed that the animal hosts play critical roles in regulating these processes, far less is known about the molecular underpinnings that allow the corals to induce the changes in their symbionts. We tested symbiont cell proliferation and life stage changes in vitro in response to different nutrient-limiting conditions to determine the key nutrients and to compare the respective symbiont transcriptomic profiles to cells in hospite. We then examined the effects of nutrient repletion on symbiont proliferation in coral hosts and quantified life stage transitions in vitro using time-lapse confocal imaging. Here, we show that symbionts in hospite share gene expression and pathway activation profiles with free-living cells under nitrogen-limited conditions, strongly suggesting that symbiont proliferation in symbiosis is limited by nitrogen availability. We demonstrate that nitrogen limitation not only suppresses cell proliferation but also life stage transition to maintain symbionts in the immobile coccoid stage. Nutrient repletion experiments in corals further confirmed that nitrogen availability is the major factor limiting symbiont density in hospite.

Denitrifying prokaryotes capable of reducing nitrate or nitrite to dinitrogen could thus support coral holobiont functioning by limiting N availability. Octocorals show some of the highest denitrification rates among reef organisms; however, little is known about the community structures of associated denitrifiers and their response to environmental fluctuations. Combining 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with <i>nirS in-silico</i> PCR and quantitative PCR, we found differences in bacterial community dynamics between two octocorals exposed to excess dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and concomitant warming. Although bacterial communities of the gorgonian <i>Pinnigorgia flava</i> remained largely unaffected by DOC and warming, the soft coral <i>Xenia umbellata</i> exhibited a pronounced shift toward <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> dominance under excess DOC. Likewise, the relative abundance of denitrifiers was not altered in <i>P. flava</i> but decreased by 1 order of magnitude in <i>X. umbellata</i> under excess DOC, likely due to decreased proportions of <i>Ruegeria</i> spp. Given that holobiont C:N ratios remained stable in <i>P. flava</i> but showed a pronounced increase with excess DOC in <i>X. umbellata</i>, our results suggest that microbial community dynamics may reflect the nutritional status of the holobiont. Hence, denitrifier abundance may be directly linked to N availability. This suggests a passive regulation of N cycling microbes based on N availability, which could help stabilize nutrient limitation in the coral-algal symbiosis and thereby support holobiont functioning in a changing environment. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Octocorals are important members of reef-associated benthic communities that can rapidly replace scleractinian corals as the dominant ecosystem engineers on degraded reefs. Considering the substantial change in the (a)biotic environment that is commonly driving reef degradation, maintaining a dynamic and metabolically diverse microbial community might contribute to octocoral acclimatization. Nitrogen (N) cycling microbes, in particular denitrifying prokaryotes, may support holobiont functioning by limiting internal N availability, but little is known about the identity and (a)biotic drivers of octocoral-associated denitrifiers. Here, we show contrasting dynamics of bacterial communities associated with two common octocoral species, the soft coral <i>Xenia umbellata</i> and the gorgonian <i>Pinnigorgia flava</i> after a 6-week exposure to excess dissolved organic carbon under concomitant warming conditions. The specific responses of denitrifier communities of the two octocoral species aligned with the nutritional status of holobiont members.

The objective of this study was to develop a suitable protocol for the coral symbiont <i>Breviolum</i> subjected to two-step freezing. The thawed <i>Breviolum</i> were then cultured for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before they were analyzed by Western blot for protein expression, light-harvesting protein (LHP), and red fluorescent protein (RFP) and tested by adenosine triphosphate bioassay for cell viability. The results showed the highest cell viability for thawed <i>Breviolum</i> that was treated with 2 M propylene glycol (PG) and 2 M methanol (MeOH) and equilibrated with both cryoprotectants for 30 min and 20 min. Both treatment groups demonstrated a significant increase in cell population after 28 days of culture post-thawing, especially for the MeOH treatment group, whose growth rate was twice of the PG treatment group. Regarding protein expression, the total amounts of each type of protein were significantly affected by cryopreservation. After 28 days of culture, the protein expression for the MeOH treatment group showed no significant difference to that of the control group, whereas the protein expression for the PG treatment group showed a significant difference. <i>Breviolum</i> that were frozen with MeOH recovered faster upon thawing than those frozen with PG. LHP was positively and RFP was negatively correlated with Symbiodiniaceae viability and so could serve as health-informing biomarkers. This work represents the first time to document it in Symbiodiniaceae, and this study established a suitable protocol for the cryopreservation of <i>Breviolum</i> and further refined the current understanding of the impact of low temperature on its protein expression.

To test this hypothesis, we determined thermal tolerance thresholds of GoA versus central Red Sea (CRS) Stylophora pistillata corals using multi-temperature acute thermal stress assays to determine thermal thresholds. Relative thermal thresholds of GoA and CRS corals were indeed similar and exceptionally high (~7 above MMM). However, absolute thermal thresholds of CRS corals were on average 3 above those of GoA corals. To explore the molecular underpinnings, we determined gene expression and microbiome response of the coral holobiont. Transcriptomic responses differed markedly, with a strong response to the thermal stress in GoA corals and their symbiotic algae versus a remarkably muted response in CRS colonies. Concomitant to this, coral and algal genes showed temperature-induced expression in GoA corals, while exhibiting fixed high expression (front-loading) in CRS corals. Bacterial community composition of GoA corals changed dramatically under heat stress, whereas CRS corals displayed stable assemblages. We interpret the response of GoA corals as that of a resilient population approaching a tipping point in contrast to a pattern of consistently elevated thermal resistance in CRS corals that cannot further attune.

Yet, some holobionts exhibit resistance to dysbiosis in eutrophic environments, including the obligate photosymbiotic scyphomedusa Cassiopea xamachana.

We combined labelled bicarbonate (<sup>13</sup>C) and nitrate (<sup>15</sup>N) with metabarcoding approaches to evaluate nutrient cycling and microbial community composition in symbiotic and aposymbiotic medusae. C-fixation and cycling by algal Symbiodiniaceae was essential for C. xamachana as even at high heterotrophic feeding rates aposymbiotic medusae continuously lost weight. Heterotrophically acquired C and N were readily shared among host and algae. This was in sharp contrast to nitrate assimilation by Symbiodiniaceae, which appeared to be strongly restricted. Instead, the bacterial microbiome seemed to play a major role in the holobiont's DIN assimilation as uptake rates showed a significant positive relationship with phylogenetic diversity of medusa-associated bacteria. This is corroborated by inferred functional capacity that links the dominant bacterial taxa (~90 %) to nitrogen cycling.

However, established E. diaphana clonal lines are not available in Australia thus limiting the ability of Australian scientists to conduct research with this model. To help address this, the bacterial and Symbiodiniaceae associates of four Great Barrier Reef (GBR)-sourced E. diaphana genotypes established in laboratory aquaria and designated AIMS1-4, and from proxies of wild GBR E. diaphana were identified by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and eukaryotic rRNA gene ITS2 region. The relationship between AIMS1-4 and their bacterial associates was investigated, as was bacterial community phenotypic potential. Existing data from two existing anemone clonal lines, CC7 and H2, were included for comparison. Overall, 2238 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were observed in the AIMS1-4 bacterial communities, which were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, together comprising >90% relative abundance. Although many low abundance bacterial taxa varied between the anemone genotypes, the AIMS1-4 communities did not differ significantly. A significant tank effect was identified, indicating an environmental effect on the microbial communities. Bacterial community richness was lower in all lab-maintained E. diaphana compared to the wild proxies, suggesting a reduction in bacterial diversity and community phenotypic potential due to culturing. Seventeen ASVs were common to every GBR lab-cultured anemone, however five were associated with the Artemia feedstock, making their specific association to E. diaphana uncertain. The dominant Symbiodiniaceae symbiont in all GBR anemones was Breviolum minutum. Despite differences in the presence and abundance of low abundance taxa, the bacterial communities of GBR-sourced lab-cultured E. diaphana are generally uniform and comparable to communities reported for other lab-cultured E. diaphana. The data presented here add to the global E. diaphana knowledge base and make an important contribution to the establishment of a GBR-sourced coral model organism.",33499977

Although numerous types of Symbiodiniaceae occur in coral reef environments, Acropora corals select specific types in early life stages. In order to study molecular mechanisms of coral-algal symbioses occurring in nature, we performed whole-genome transcriptomic analyses of Acropora tenuis larvae inoculated with Symbiodinium microadriaticum strains isolated from an Acropora recruit. In order to identify genes specifically involved in symbioses with native symbionts in early life stages, we also investigated transcriptomic responses of Acropora larvae exposed to closely related, nonsymbiotic, and occasionally symbiotic Symbiodinium strains. We found that the number of differentially expressed genes was largest when larvae acquired native symbionts. Repertoires of differentially expressed genes indicated that corals reduced amino acid, sugar, and lipid metabolism, such that metabolic enzymes performing these functions were derived primarily from S.microadriaticum rather than from A.tenuis. Upregulated gene expression of transporters for those metabolites occurred only when coral larvae acquired their natural symbionts, suggesting active utilization of native symbionts by host corals. We also discovered that in Acropora, genes for sugar and amino acid transporters, prosaposin-like, and Notch ligand-like, were upregulated only in response to native symbionts, and included tandemly duplicated genes.

We identified >500 genes that showed rapid and extensive up-regulation upon temperature increase. These genes fell into two clusters. In both clusters, most genes showed similar expression patterns in symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones, suggesting that this early stress response is largely independent of the symbiosis. Cluster I was highly enriched for genes involved in innate immunity and apoptosis, and most transcript levels returned to baseline many hours before bleaching was first detected, raising doubts about their possible roles in this process. Cluster II was highly enriched for genes involved in protein folding, and most transcript levels returned more slowly to baseline, so that roles in either promoting or preventing bleaching seem plausible. Many of the genes in clusters I and II appear to be targets of the transcription factors NFB and HSF1, respectively. We also examined the behavior of 337 genes whose much higher levels of expression in symbiotic than aposymbiotic anemones in the absence of stress suggest that they are important for the symbiosis.

Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has extended the coral's metabolic capacity through metabolic handoffs and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and has contributed to the ecological success of these iconic organisms. It necessitated the prior existence or the evolution of a series of adaptations of the host to attract and select the right symbionts, to provide them with a suitable environment and to remove disfunctional symbionts. Signatures of microbial symbiosis in the coral genome include HGT from Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, gene family expansions, and a broad repertoire of oxidative stress response and innate immunity genes. Symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae has permitted corals to occupy oligotrophic waters as the algae provide most corals with the majority of their nutrition. However, the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis is sensitive to climate warming, which disrupts this intimate relationship, causing coral bleaching, mortality and a worldwide decline of coral reefs.

Successful exchange of molecules between the cnidarian host and the Symbiodiniaceae algae enables the mutualistic partnership. The algae translocate photosynthate to their host in exchange for nutrients and shelter. The photosynthate must traverse multiple membranes, most likely facilitated by transporters. Here, we compared gene expression profiles of cultured, free-living <i>Breviolum minutum</i> with those of the homologous symbionts freshly isolated from the sea anemone <i>Exaiptasia diaphana</i>, a widely used model for coral hosts. Additionally, we assessed expression levels of a list of candidate host transporters of interest in anemones with and without symbionts. Our transcriptome analyses highlight the distinctive nature of the two algal life stages, with many gene expression level changes correlating to the different morphologies, cell cycles, and metabolisms adopted <i>in hospite</i> versus free-living. Morphogenesis-related genes that likely underpin the metamorphosis process observed when symbionts enter a host cell were up-regulated. Conversely, many down-regulated genes appear to be indicative of the protective and confined nature of the symbiosome. Our results emphasize the significance of transmembrane transport to the symbiosis, and in particular of ammonium and sugar transport.

We utilized literature-derived lists of ""symbiosis differentially expressed genes"" and ""coral heat-stress genes"" in order to compare between the treatments. The symbiotic and apo-symbiotic samples were segregated into two separate groups with several different enriched gene ontologies. Our findings suggest that the presence of endosymbionts has a greater negative impact on the host than the environmental temperature conditions experienced by the holobiont. The peak of the stress reaction was identified as 28 C, with the highest number of differentially expressed genes. We suggest that the algal symbionts increase coral holobiont susceptibility to elevated temperatures.

Recent studies have shown that elevated seawater temperatures can cause the collapse of their endosymbiosis, known as 'bleaching', and result in mass mortality. However, the molecular interplay between temperature responses and symbiotic states still remains unclear. To identify candidate genes relevant to the symbiotic stability, we performed transcriptomic analyses under multiple conditions using the symbiotic and apo-symbiotic (symbiont free) <i>Exaiptasia diaphana</i>, an emerging model sea anemone. Gene expression patterns showed that large parts of differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress were specific to the symbiotic state, suggesting that the host sea anemone could react to environmental changes in a symbiotic state-dependent manner. Comparative analysis of expression profiles under multiple conditions highlighted candidate genes potentially important in the symbiotic state transition under heat-induced bleaching. Many of these genes were functionally associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolisms in lysosomes. Symbiont algal genes differentially expressed <i>in hospite</i> encode proteins related to heat shock response, calcium signaling, organellar protein transport, and sugar metabolism. Our data suggest that heat stress alters gene expression in both the hosts and symbionts.

Since Symbiodinium clades C and D showed very different rates of density increase, comparisons were made of early onsets of both symbionts, revealing that the host behaved differently for each. RNA-sequencing showed that the number of differentially-expressed genes in corals colonized by clade D increased ca. two-fold from 10 to 20 days, whereas corals with clade C showed unremarkable changes consistent with a slow rate of density increase.

As most eukaryotic DNA in coral samples was derived from hosts, protist diversity was missed in metagenome analyses. To tackle this issue, we designed blocking primers for Scleractinia sequences amplified with two primer sets that targeted variable loops of the 18S rRNA gene (18SV1V2 and 18SV4). These blocking primers were used on environmental colonies of <i>Pocillopora damicornis sensu lato</i> from two regions with contrasting thermal regimes (Djibouti and New Caledonia).

In corals, the interpretation of rhythmic behaviours is complicated by the daily oscillations in tissue oxygen tension resulting from the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of the associated algal endosymbiont Symbiodinium. In order to better understand the integration of biological clocks in cnidarian hosts of Symbiodinium, daily rhythms of behaviour and gene expression were studied in symbiotic and aposymbiotic morphs of the sea-anemone Aiptasia diaphana. The results showed that whereas circatidal (approx. 12-h) cycles of activity and gene expression predominated in aposymbiotic morphs, circadian (approx. 24-h) patterns were the more common in symbiotic morphs, where the expression of a significant number of genes shifted from a 12- to 24-h rhythm. The behavioural experiments on symbiotic A. diaphana displayed diel (24-h) rhythmicity in body and tentacle contraction under the light/dark cycles, whereas aposymbiotic morphs showed approximately 12-h (circatidal) rhythmicity. Reinfection experiments represent an important step in understanding the hierarchy of endogenous clocks in symbiotic associations, where the aposymbiotic Aiptasia morphs returned to a 24-h behavioural rhythm after repopulation with algae. Whilst some modification of host metabolism is to be expected, the extent to which the presence of the algae modified host endogenous behavioural and transcriptional rhythms implies that it is the symbionts that influence the pace.

To this end, this study set out to investigate the genetic structure of the coral, Platygyra daedalea, and its symbiotic algae in the PAG and neighbouring Gulf of Oman. Using nuclear markers (the ITS region and an intron of the Pax-C gene), this study demonstrates genetic divergence of P. daedalea on reefs within the thermally extreme PAG compared with those in the neighbouring Gulf of Oman. Isolation by distance of P. daedalea was supported by the ITS dataset but not the Pax-C intron. In addition, the symbiont community within the PAG was dominated by C3 symbionts, while the purportedly thermotolerant clade D was extremely rare and was common only at sites outside of the PAG. Analysis of the psbAncr indicates that the C3 variant hosted by P. daedalea in the PAG belongs to the newly described species, Symbiodinium thermophilum. The structuring of the coral and symbiont populations suggests that both partners of the symbiosis may contribute to the high bleaching thresholds of PAG corals.

The structurally similar mitochondrial genomes of Chromera and Vitrella differ in gene content, which is reflected in the composition of their respiratory chains. Thus, Chromera lacks respiratory complexes I and III, whereas Vitrella and apicomplexan parasites are missing only complex I. Plastid genomes differ substantially between these algae, particularly in structure: The Chromera plastid genome is a linear, 120-kb molecule with large and divergent genes, whereas the plastid genome of Vitrella is a highly compact circle that is only 85 kb long but nonetheless contains more genes than that of Chromera. It appears that organellar genomes have already been reduced in free-living phototrophic ancestors of apicomplexan parasites, and such reduction is not associated with parasitism.",26092225
"""coral"" AND ""algae"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Diversification of the light-harvesting complex gene family via intra- and intergenic duplications in the coral symbiotic alga Symbiodinium.,"The light-harvesting complex (LHC) is an essential component in light energy capture and transduction to facilitate downstream photosynthetic reactions in plant and algal chloroplasts. The unicellular dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium is an endosymbiont of cnidarian animals, including corals and sea anemones, and provides carbohydrates generated through photosynthesis to host animals. Although Symbiodinium possesses a unique LHC gene family, called chlorophyll a-chlorophyll c2-peridinin protein complex (acpPC), its genome-level diversity and evolutionary trajectories have not been investigated. Here, we describe a phylogenetic analysis revealing that many of the LHCs are encoded by highly duplicated genes with multi-subunit polyprotein structures in the nuclear genome of Symbiodinium minutum. This analysis provides an extended list of the LHC gene family in a single organism, including 80 loci encoding polyproteins composed of 145 LHC subunits recovered in the phylogenetic tree. In S. minutum, 5 phylogenetic groups of the Lhcf-type gene family, which is exclusively conserved in algae harboring secondary plastids of red algal origin, were identified. Moreover, 5 groups of the Lhcr-type gene family, of which members are known to be associated with PSI in red algal plastids and secondary plastids of red algal origin, were identified. Notably, members classified within a phylogenetic group of the Lhcf-type (group F1) are highly duplicated, which may explain the presence of an unusually large number of LHC genes in this species. Some gene units were homologous to other units within single loci of the polyprotein genes, whereas intergenic homologies between separate loci were conspicuous in other cases, implying that gene unit 'shuffling' by gene conversion and/or genome rearrangement might have been a driving force for diversification. These results suggest that vigorous intra- and intergenic gene duplication events have resulted in the genomic framework of photosynthesis in coral symbiont dinoflagellate algae.",25741697

Shallow water reefs depend on the obligatory symbiosis between the habitat forming coral host and its algal symbiont from the genus Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae). This association is highly sensitive to thermal perturbations and temperatures as little as 1C above the average summer maxima can cause the breakdown of this symbiosis, termed coral bleaching. Predicting the capacity of corals to survive the expected increase in seawater temperatures depends strongly on our understanding of the thermal tolerance of the symbiotic algae. Here we use molecular phylogenetic analysis of four genetic markers to describe Symbiodinium thermophilum, sp. nov. from the Persian/Arabian Gulf, a thermally tolerant coral symbiont. Phylogenetic inference using the non-coding region of the chloroplast psbA gene resolves S. thermophilum as a monophyletic lineage with large genetic distances from any other ITS2 C3 type found outside the Gulf.

Dysfunction of this symbiosis under changing environmental conditions has led to global reef decline. Little information is known about Symbiodinium gene expression and mechanisms by which light impacts host-symbiont associations. To address these issues, we generated a transcriptome from axenic Symbiodinium strain SSB01. Here we report features of the transcriptome, including occurrence and length distribution of spliced leader sequences, the functional landscape of encoded proteins and the impact of light on gene expression. Expression of many Symbiodinium genes appears to be significantly impacted by light. Transcript encoding cryptochrome 2 declined in high light while some transcripts for Regulators of Chromatin Condensation (RCC1) declined in the dark. We also identified a transcript encoding a light harvesting AcpPC protein with homology to Chlamydomonas LHCSR2. The level of this transcript increased in high light autotrophic conditions, suggesting that it is involved in photo-protection and the dissipation of excess absorbed light energy. The most extensive changes in transcript abundances occurred when the algae were transferred from low light to darkness. Interestingly, transcripts encoding several cell adhesion proteins rapidly declined following movement of cultures to the dark, which correlated with a dramatic change in cell surface morphology, likely reflecting the complexity of the extracellular matrix. Thus, light-sensitive cell adhesion proteins may play a role in establishing surface architecture, which may in turn alter interactions between the endosymbiont and its host.",25664570

During these treatments, corals had noticeably bleached. The photosynthetic performance of residual algal endosymbionts was severely impaired but showed signs of recovery in both treatments by the end of the second day. Changes in the coral proteome were determined daily and, using recently available annotated genome sequences, the individual contributions of the coral host and algal endosymbionts could be extracted from these data. Quantitative changes in proteins relevant to redox state and calcium metabolism are presented. Notably, expression of common antioxidant proteins was not detected from the coral host but present in the algal endosymbiont proteome. Possible roles for elevated carbonic anhydrase in the coral host are considered: to restore intracellular pH diminished by loss of photosynthetic activity, to indirectly limit intracellular calcium influx linked with enhanced calmodulin expression to impede late-stage symbiont exocytosis, or to enhance inorganic carbon transport to improve the photosynthetic performance of algal symbionts that remain in hospite. Protein effectors of calcium-dependent exocytosis were present in both symbiotic partners. No caspase-family proteins associated with host cell apoptosis, with exception of the autophagy chaperone HSP70, were detected, suggesting that algal loss and photosynthetic dysfunction under these experimental conditions were not due to host-mediated phytosymbiont destruction. Instead, bleaching occurred by symbiont exocytosis and loss of light-harvesting pigments of algae that remain in hospite. These proteomic data are, therefore, consistent with our premise that coral endosymbionts can mediate their own retention or departure from the coral host, which may manifest as ""symbiont shuffling"" of Symbiodinium clades in response to environmental stress.",25561505
"""coral"" AND ""algae"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Gene expression of corals in response to macroalgal competitors.,"As corals decline and macroalgae proliferate on coral reefs, coral-macroalgal competition becomes more frequent and ecologically important. Whether corals are damaged by these interactions depends on susceptibility of the coral and traits of macroalgal competitors. Investigating changes in gene expression of corals and their intracellular symbiotic algae, Symbiodinium, in response to contact with different macroalgae provides insight into the biological processes and cellular pathways affected by competition with macroalgae. We evaluated the gene expression profiles of coral and Symbiodinium genes from two confamilial corals, Acropora millepora and Montipora digitata, after 6 h and 48 h of contact with four common macroalgae that differ in their allelopathic potency to corals. Contacts with macroalgae affected different biological pathways in the more susceptible (A. millepora) versus the more resistant (M. digitata) coral. Genes of coral hosts and of their associated Symbiodinium also responded in species-specific and time-specific ways to each macroalga. Changes in number and expression intensity of affected genes were greater after 6 h compared to 48 h of contact and were greater following contact with Chlorodesmis fastigiata and Amphiroa crassa than following contact with Galaxaura filamentosa or Turbinaria conoides. We documented a divergence in transcriptional responses between two confamilial corals and their associated Symbiodinium, as well as a diversity of dynamic responses within each coral species with respect to the species of macroalgal competitor and the duration of exposure to that competitor. These responses included early initiation of immune processes by Montipora, which is more resistant to damage after long-term macroalgal contact. Activation of the immune response by corals that better resist algal competition is consistent with the hypothesis that some macroalgal effects on corals may be mediated by microbial pathogens.",25500576

These mechanisms, including host-symbiont recognition and metabolic exchange, control symbiosis stability under normal conditions, but also lead to symbiosis breakdown (bleaching) during stress. This study describes the repertoire of the sterol-trafficking proteins Niemann-Pick type C (NPC1 and NPC2) in the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. We found one NPC1 gene in contrast to the two genes (NPC1 and NPC1L1) present in vertebrate genomes. While only one NPC2 gene is present in many metazoans, this gene has been duplicated in cnidarians, and we detected four NPC2 genes in A. viridis. However, only one gene (AvNPC2-d) was upregulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic sea anemones and displayed higher expression in the gastrodermis (symbiont-containing tissue) than in the epidermis. We performed immunolabelling experiments on tentacle cross sections and demonstrated that the AvNPC2-d protein was closely associated with symbiosomes. In addition, AvNPC1 and AvNPC2-d gene expression was strongly downregulated during stress. These data suggest that AvNPC2-d is involved in both the stability and dysfunction of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses.",25066219

Diversity in host-symbiont pairings on the sub-species level could be an unrecognized source of functional variation in response to stress. The Caribbean elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, associates predominantly with one symbiont species (Symbiodinium 'fitti'), facilitating investigations of individual-level (genotype) interactions. Individual genotypes of both host and symbiont were resolved across the entire species' range. Most colonies of a particular animal genotype were dominated by one symbiont genotype (or strain) that may persist in the host for decades or more. While Symbiodinium are primarily clonal, the occurrence of recombinant genotypes indicates sexual recombination is the source of this genetic variation, and some evidence suggests this happens within the host. When these data are examined at spatial scales spanning the entire distribution of A.palmata, gene flow among animal populations was an order of magnitude greater than among populations of the symbiont. This suggests that independent micro-evolutionary processes created dissimilar population genetic structures between host and symbiont. The lower effective dispersal exhibited by the dinoflagellate raises questions regarding the extent to which populations of host and symbiont can co-evolve during times of rapid and substantial climate change. However, these findings also support a growing body of evidence, suggesting that genotype-by-genotype interactions may provide significant physiological variation, influencing the adaptive potential of symbiotic reef corals to severe selection.",24909707
"""coral"" AND ""algae"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Heat-stress and light-stress induce different cellular pathologies in the symbiotic dinoflagellate during coral bleaching.,"Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat- and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 moles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat- and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e.g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor. Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by different environmental stressors is important for predicting both severity and consequences of coral bleaching.",24324575

Coral species included the symbiotic soft corals Heteroxenia fuscescens and Sinularia flexibilis, the asymbiotic scleractinian coral Tubastrea coccinea, and the symbiotic scleractinian corals Stylophora pistillata, Pavona cactus and Oculina arbuscula. Herbivory was assessed by end-point PCR amplification of algae-specific 18S rRNA gene fragments purified from coral tissue genomic DNA extracts. The ability to capture microalgae varied with coral and algal species and could not be explained by prey size or taxonomy. Herbivory was not detected in S.flexibilis and S.pistillata. P.globosa was the only algal prey that was never captured by any coral. Although predation defence mechanisms have been shown for Phaeocystis spp. against many potential predators, this study is the first to suggest this for corals.

At the protein level, four isoforms shared between 87 and 97% sequence identity for Hb-1 and 78-99% for Hb-2, whereas between Hb-1 and Hb-2 proteins, only 15-21% sequence homology has been preserved. Phylogenetic analyses of the dinoflagellate encoding Hb sequences have revealed a separate evolutionary origin of the discovered globin genes and indicated the possibility of horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptional regulation of the Hb-like genes was studied in the reef-building coral Acropora aspera exposed to elevated temperatures (6-7C above average sea temperature) over a 24-h period and a 72-h period, as well as to nutrient stress. Exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in an increased Hb-1 gene expression of 31% after 72 h only, whereas transcript abundance of the Hb-2 gene was enhanced by up to 59% by both 1-day and 3-day thermal stress conditions. Nutrient stress also increased gene expression of Hb-2 gene by 70%. Our findings describe the differential expression patterns of two novel Hb genes from symbiotic dinoflagellates and their polymorphic nature. Furthermore, the inducible nature of Hb-2 gene by both thermal and nutrient stressors indicates a prospective role of this form of hemoglobin in the initial coral-algal responses to changes in environmental conditions.

We adopted a profiling approach to explore the sensitivity of microbes associated with coral reef biofilms and representatives of three ecologically important calcifying invertebrate phyla [corals, foraminifera and crustose coralline algae (CCA)] to OA. The experimental design for this study comprised four pHs consistent with current IPCC predictions for the next few centuries (pHNIST 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5); these pH/pCO conditions were produced in flow-through aquaria using CO bubbling. All reduced pH/increased pCO treatments caused clear differences in the microbial communities associated with coral, foraminifera, CCA and reef biofilms over 6 weeks, while no visible signs of host stress were detected over this period. The microbial communities of coral, foraminifera, CCA and biofilms were significantly different between pH8.1 (pCO=464atm) and pH7.9 (pCO=822atm), a concentration likely to be exceeded by the end of the present century. This trend continued at lower pHs/higher pCO. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed variable and species-specific changes in the microbial communities with no microbial taxa consistently present or absent from specific pH treatments. The high sensitivity of coral, foraminifera, CCA and biofilm microbes to OA conditions projected to occur by 2100 is a concern for reef ecosystems and highlights the need for urgent research to assess the implications of microbial shifts for host health and coral reef processes.",23584968

In this study, we experimentally establish that Symbiodinium photosynthesis, both as a free-living unicellular algae and as part of the symbiotic association with the coral Stylophora pistillata, is 'wired' to the circadian clock mechanism with a 'free-run' cycle close to 24 h. Associated photosynthetic pigments also showed rhythmicity under light/dark conditions and under constant light conditions, while the expression of the oxygen-evolving enhancer 1 gene (within photosystem II) coincided with photosynthetically evolved oxygen in Symbiodinium cultures. Thus, circadian regulation of the Symbiodinium photosynthesis is, however, complicated as being linked to the coral/host that have probably profound physiochemical influence on the intracellular environment.

The quantity and quality of light were found to be the most influential factors governing the endogenous clock for plants and algae. Unicellular dinoflagellate algae are among the best examples of organisms that exhibit circadian clocks using light as the dominant signal. This study is the first to examine the effects of light intensity and quality on the rhythmicity of photosynthesis in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp., both as a free-living organism and in symbiosis with the coral Stylophora pistillata. Oxygen production measurements in Symbiodinium cultures exhibited rhythmicity with a periodicity of approximately 24 h under constant high light (LL), whereas under medium and low light, the cycle time increased. Exposing Symbiodinium cultures and corals to spectral light revealed different effects of blue and red light on the photosynthetic rhythm, specifically shortening or increasing the cycle time respectively. These findings suggest that the photosynthetic rhythm is entrained by different light cues, which are wired to an endogenous circadian clock. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mRNA expression was higher under blue light for two potential cryptochrome genes and higher under red light for a phytochrome gene isolated from Symbiodinium. These results offer the first evidence of the impact of the intensity and quality of light on the photosynthetic rhythm in algal cells living freely or as part of a symbiotic association.

Based on pairwise comparisons of multilocus genotypes defined separately for the mycobiont and for the photobiont, we inferred the transmission mode of the photobiont and the relative contribution of somatic mutation and recombination. After constraining the analysis of one symbiont to pairs of individuals with genetically identical symbiotic partners, we found that 77% of fungal and 70% of algal pairs were represented by clones. Thus, the predominant dispersal mode was by means of symbiotic vegetative propagules (vertical transmission), which dispersed fungal and algal clones co-dependently over a short distance, thus shaping the spatial genetic structure up to distances of 20m. Evidence for somatic mutation generating genetic diversity was found in both symbionts, accounting for 30% of pairwise comparisons in the alga and 15% in the fungus. While the alga did not show statistically significant evidence of recombination, recombination accounted for 7.7% of fungal pairs with identical algae.

To examine the molecular response of the coral Acropora microphthalma to high levels of solar irradiance, a cDNA library was constructed by PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridisation (PCR-SSH) from mRNA obtained by transplantation of a colony from a depth of 12.7 m to near-surface solar irradiance, during which the coral became noticeably paler from loss of endosymbionts in sun-exposed tissues. A novel approach to sequence annotation of the cDNA library gave genetic evidence for a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway branching from the shikimic acid pathway that leads to the formation of 4-deoxygadusol. This metabolite is a potent antioxidant and expected precursor of the UV-protective mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which serve as sunscreens in coral phototrophic symbiosis. Empirical PCR based evidence further upholds the contention that the biosynthesis of these MAA sunscreens is a 'shared metabolic adaptation' between the symbiotic partners.

The most stable expression pattern was identified for cyclophilin and S-adenosyl methionine synthetase (SAM) followed by S4 ribosomal protein (Rp-S4), Calmodulin (Cal), and Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (Cox), respectively. Thermal stress alone resulted in the highest expression stability for Rp-S4 and SAM, with a minimum of two reference genes required for data normalization. For Symbiodinium exposed to both, light and thermal stresses, at least five reference genes were recommended by geNorm analysis. In parallel, the expression of Hsp90 for Symbiodinium in culture and in symbiosis within coral host (Acropora millepora) was evaluated using the most stable HKGs. Our results revealed a drop in Hsp90 expression after an 18 h-period and a 24 h-period of exposure to elevated temperatures indicating the similar Hsp90 expression profile in symbiotic and non-symbiotic environments. This study provides the first list of the HKGs and will provide a useful reference in future gene expression studies in symbiotic dinoflagellates.",20668900
"""coral"" AND ""algae"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Role of chloroplasts and other plastids in ageing and death of plants and animals: a tale of Vishnu and Shiva.,"Chloroplasts (chlorophyll-containing plastids) and other plastids are found in all plants and many animals. They are crucial to the survival of plants and most of the animals that harbour them. An example of a non-photosynthesizing plastid in animals is the apicoplast in the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, which is required for survival of the parasite. Many animals (such as sea slugs, sponges, reef corals, and clams) consume prey containing chloroplasts, or feed on algae. Some of these incorporate the chloroplasts from their food, or whole algal cells, into their own cells. Other species from these groups place algal cells between their own cells. Reef-building corals often lose their intracellular algae as a result of environmental changes, resulting in coral bleaching and death. The sensitivity of the chloroplast internal membranes to temperature stress is one of the reasons for coral death. Chloroplasts can also be a causal factor in the processes leading to whole-plant death, as the knockout of a gene encoding a chloroplast protein delayed the yellowing that proceeds death in tobacco plants. It is concluded that chloroplasts and other plastids are essential to individual survival in many species, including animals, and that they also play a role in triggering death in some plant and animal species.",19720162

Their immense ecological success is due to a symbiotic association between cnidarian hosts and unicellular dinoflagellate algae, known as zooxanthellae. These algae are photosynthetic and the cnidarian-zooxanthellae association is based on nutritional exchanges. Maintenance of such an intimate cellular partnership involves many crosstalks between the partners. To better characterize symbiotic relationships between a cnidarian host and its dinoflagellate symbionts, we conducted a large-scale EST study on a symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, in which the two tissue layers (epiderm and gastroderm) can be easily separated. A single cDNA library was constructed from symbiotic tissue of sea anemones A. viridis in various environmental conditions (both normal and stressed). We generated 39,939 high quality ESTs, which were assembled into 14,504 unique sequences (UniSeqs). Sequences were analysed and sorted according to their putative origin (animal, algal or bacterial). We identified many new repeated elements in the 3'UTR of most animal genes, suggesting that these elements potentially have a biological role, especially with respect to gene expression regulation. We identified genes of animal origin that have no homolog in the non-symbiotic starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis genome, but in other symbiotic cnidarians, and may therefore be involved in the symbiosis relationship in A. viridis. Comparison of protein domain occurrence in A. viridis with that in N. vectensis demonstrated an increase in abundance of some molecular functions, such as protein binding or antioxidant activity, suggesting that these functions are essential for the symbiotic state and may be specific adaptations. This large dataset of sequences provides a valuable resource for future studies on symbiotic interactions in Cnidaria. The comparison with the closest available genome, the sea anemone N. vectensis, as well as with EST datasets from other symbiotic cnidarians provided a set of candidate genes involved in symbiosis-related molecular crosstalks. Altogether, these results provide new molecular insights that could be used as a starting-point for further functional genomics studies.",19627569

The molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment, maintenance, and breakdown of the symbiotic partnership are, however, not well understood. Efforts to dissect these questions have been slow, as corals are notoriously difficult to work with. In order to expedite this field of research, we generated and analyzed a collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida and its dinoflagellate symbiont (Symbiodinium sp.), a system that is gaining popularity as a model to study cellular, molecular, and genomic questions related to cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. A set of 4,925 unique sequences (UniSeqs) comprising 1,427 clusters of 2 or more ESTs (contigs) and 3,498 unclustered ESTs (singletons) was generated by analyzing 10,285 high-quality ESTs from a mixed host/symbiont cDNA library. Using a BLAST-based approach to predict which unique sequences derived from the host versus symbiont genomes, we found that the contribution of the symbiont genome to the transcriptome was surprisingly small (1.6-6.4%). This may reflect low levels of gene expression in the symbionts, low coverage of alveolate genes in the sequence databases, a small number of symbiont cells relative to the total cellular content of the anemones, or failure to adequately lyse symbiont cells. Furthermore, we were able to identify groups of genes that are known or likely to play a role in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, including oxidative stress pathways that emerged as a prominent biological feature of this transcriptome. All ESTs and UniSeqs along with annotation results and other tools have been made accessible through the implementation of a publicly accessible database named AiptasiaBase. We have established the first large-scale transcriptomic resource for Aiptasia pallida and its dinoflagellate symbiont. These data provide researchers with tools to study questions related to cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses on a molecular, cellular, and genomic level. This groundwork represents a crucial step towards the establishment of a tractable model system that can be utilized to better understand cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses.

The molecular diversity of Symbiodinium has been described mainly by use of ribosomal DNA sequence data. We tested whether minicircle sequences, which appear to form the chloroplast genome in many dinoflagellates, could be used as a marker for molecular diversity among symbionts found in corals and sea anemones. Partial and full-length sequences for psbA were obtained from environmental samples of coral and sea anemones of wide-ranging geographical distribution. Phylogenetic trees constructed with partial psbA sequences were consistent with the known phylotypes of the isolates. Further sequencing suggested that the psbA gene is present on a minicircle in all Symbiodinium phylotypes. The length and DNA sequence of the non-coding portion of the minicircles varied considerably among Symbiodinium phylotypes. In two Symbiodinium isolates from different phylotypes an elaborate pattern of repeat sequences of unknown function was found in the non-coding region. Phylogenetic analysis of the non-coding region of the psbA minicircle indicates that minicircle sequences could be a useful chloroplast-derived marker for differentiating both closely related and distantly related Symbiodinium isolates.",16618551

The examination of this phase in coral-algae symbiosis from a molecular point of view is still at an early stage. In the present study we used 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to compare patterns of proteins synthesized in symbiotic and aposymbiotic primary polyps of the Red Sea soft coral Heteroxenia fuscescens.

The significance of these bleaching events to the health of coral reef ecosystems is extreme, as bleached corals exhibit high mortality, reduced fecundity and productivity and increased susceptibility to disease. This decreased coral fitness leads to reef degradation and ultimately to the breakdown of the coral reef ecosystem. To date there has been little work describing the application of biomarkers to assess coral health. The most commonly applied biomarker is, in fact, the bleaching event itself. We are interested in developing early warning biomarkers that can detect coral stress before bleaching occurs. Recently, several genes that are likely to function in regulating interactions between cnidarians and their symbionts have been characterized, using the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima as a model species. One ""symbiosis gene"" identified from the host genome, sym32, is expressed as a function of anemone symbiotic-state, where sym32 expression is higher in symbiotic cf. aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) anemones. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the level of sym32 expression was correlated with the abundance of algae in the host. Furthermore, laboratory exposures of anemones to low levels of cadmium (0, 20, 100 microg(-1) CdCl2; 14 days), which caused no change in algal cell numbers, resulted in a down-regulation of sym32 compared to controls, indicating that sym32 expression may serve as a new sensitive early warning biomarker of cnidarian-algal symbiosis breakdown.",12408586

To address these challenges, as a first step, we established a simplified co-culture system using a partially oil-sealed co-culture system (POS-CCS). Using Lactobacillus paragasseri and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum as model microorganisms, we successfully co-cultured them with MDCK cells and analysed their growth using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our system allowed the individual measurement of growth curves of both bacterial species, and changes in the transepithelial electrical resistance of epithelial cells, cell viability, pH, and concentration of bacterial cells during co-culture. Notably, co-culture with MDCK cells led to a rapid decrease in pH, which coincided with an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance, suggesting a potential link between bacterial metabolism and epithelial barrier function. Furthermore, MDCK cells promoted the growth of both L. paragasseri and B. longum subsp. longum.

Children and adolescents with HCLD in Harare, Zimbabwe and Blantyre, Malawi were recruited in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of once-weekly AZM or placebo for 48 weeks (BREATHE trial, NCT02426112). Rectal swabs were collected at inclusion (N = 346), 48 weeks (treatment end, N = 313), and 72 weeks (six months after treatment cessation, N = 244). The bacterial composition of fecal swabs was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma biomarkers at inclusion and 48 weeks were measured using Luminex multiplex bead assay. At 48 weeks, bacterial -diversity was significantly lower in the AZM group, with 27 bacterial genera showing differential abundance between the study groups. The placebo group exhibited higher interconnectivity between bacterial genera at 48 weeks compared to the AZM group. Correlations between the top seven differentially abundant genera and biomarkers observed at inclusion were no longer significant at 48 weeks in both groups.

Crosstalk between gut microbes and the host plays a key role in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases, yet little is known about how the miRNA-gut microbiome axis contributes to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Here, we investigate the ability of miR-21, a miRNA that we found decreased in fecal samples from IBS patients, to associate with and regulate gut microbiome function. When incubated with the human fecal microbiota, miR-21 revealed a rapid internalization or binding to microbial cells, which varied in extent across different donor samples. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and sequencing of microbial cells incubated with fluorescently labeled miR-21 identified organisms belonging to the genera <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Limosilactobacillus</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, or <i>Coprococcus</i>, which predominantly interacted with miR-21. Surprisingly, these and other genera also interacted with a miRNA scramble control, suggesting that physical interaction and/or uptake of these miRNAs by gut microbiota is not sequence-dependent. Nevertheless, transcriptomic analysis of the gut commensal <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> revealed a miRNA sequence-specific effect on bacterial transcript levels. Supplementation of miR-21, but not of small RNA controls, resulted in significantly altered levels of many cellular transcripts and increased transcription of a biosynthetic operon for indole and L-tryptophan, metabolites known to regulate host inflammation and colonic motility. Our study identifies a novel putative miR-21-dependent pathway of regulation of intestinal function through the gut microbiome with implications for gastrointestinal conditions. The mammalian gut represents one of the largest and most dynamic host-microbe interfaces. Host-derived microRNAs (miRNAs), released from the gut epithelium into the lumen, have emerged as important contributors to host-microbe crosstalk. Levels of several miRNAs are altered in the stool of patients with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Understanding how miRNAs interact with and shape gut microbiota function is crucial as it may enable the development of new targeted treatments for intestinal diseases. This study provides evidence that the miRNA miR-21 can rapidly associate with diverse microbial cells form the gut and increase levels of transcripts involved in tryptophan synthesis in a ubiquitous gut microbe. Tryptophan catabolites regulate key functions, such as gut immune response or permeability.

To reveal host-microbe interactions, we assessed their overall correspondence and identified treatment-specific pairs of species and host expressed genes that showed significant correlations over time. Our analysis revealed that factors such as developmental age substantially impacted the cecum ecosystem more than feed additives. While feed additives significantly altered microbial compositions in the later stages, they did not significantly affect overall host gene expression. The differential expression indicated that with AGP administration, host transmembrane transporters and metallopeptidase activities were upregulated around day 21. Together with the modulated kininogen binding and phenylpyruvate tautomerase activity over time, this likely contributes to the growth-promoting effects of AGPs. The difference in responses between AGP and PFA supplementation suggests that these additives operate through distinct mechanisms. We investigated the impact of a common AGP and its natural alternative on poultry cecum ecosystem through an integrated analysis of both the microbiota and host responses. We found that AGP appears to enhance host nutrient utilization and modulate immune responses. The insights we gained are critical for identifying and developing effective AGP alternatives to advance sustainable livestock farming practices.",39687871
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Butyrate metabolism in rumen epithelium affected by host and diet regime through regulating microbiota in a goat model.,"The rumen is an important organ that enables ruminants to digest nutrients. However, the biological mechanism by which the microbiota and its derived fatty acids regulate rumen development is still unclear. In this study, 18 female Haimen goats were selected and slaughtered at d 30, 60, and 90 of age. Multi-omics analyses (rumen microbial sequencing, host transcriptome sequencing, and rumen epithelial metabolomics) were performed to investigate host-microbe interactions from preweaning to postweaning in a goat model. With increasing age, and after the introduction of solid feed, the increased abundances of <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> showed positive correlations with volatile fatty acid (VFA) levels and morphological parameters (<i>P</i><0.05). Epithelial transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression levels of hub genes, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase isoform 2 (<i>HMGCS2</i>), enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain 1 (<i>ECHS1</i>), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (<i>PPARG</i>), were positively associated with animal phenotype (<i>P</i><0.05). These hub genes were mainly correlated to VFA metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and the mammaliantargetofrapamycin (mTOR) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways (<i>P</i><0.05). Moreover, the primary metabolites in the epithelium changed from glucose preweaning to (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) and acetoacetic acid (ACAC) postweaning (<i>P</i><0.05). Diet and butyrate were the major factors shaping epithelial metabolomics in young ruminants (<i>P</i><0.05). Multi-omics analysis showed that the rumen microbiota and VFA were mainly associated with the epithelial transcriptome, and that alterations in gene expression influenced host metabolism. The ""butanoate metabolism"" pathway, which transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified as being upregulated with age, produces ketones that regulate the ""oxidative phosphorylation"" pathway, which could provide energy for the development of rumen papillae. Our findings reveal the changes that occur in the rumen microbiota, host transcriptome, and metabolome with age, and validate the role of microbiota-derived VFA in manipulating host gene expression and subsequent metabolism. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions in goats and supplies a theoretical basis and guidance for precise nutritional regulation during the critical time window for rumen development of young ruminants.",39628645

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Sulfonation metabolism in the gut microbiota is the main metabolic pathway of cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic mice.,"The interactions between dietary cholesterol and intestinal microbiota strongly affect host health. Sulfonation is a major conjugating pathway responsible for regulating the chemical and functional homeostasis of endogenous and exogenous molecules. However, the role of cholesterol sulfonation metabolism in the host remains unclear. This work was designed to profile cholesterol-specific host-microbe interaction and conversion focusing on cholesterol sulfonation metabolism. Results indicated that the serum and fecal cholesterol sulfate (CHS) levels were significantly higher than those of total bile acid (TBA) levels in hypercholesterolemic mice. Deletion of the gut microbiota by antibiotics could dramatically increase total cholesterol (TC) levels but it decreased CHS levels in a pseudo-germ-free (PGF) mouse host. 16S rRNA gene sequencing assay and correlation analysis between the abundance of various intestinal bacteria (phylum and class) and the CHS/TC ratio showed that the intestinal genera <i>Bacteroides</i> contributed essentially to cholesterol sulfonation metabolism. These results were further confirmed in an <i>in situ</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> mouse intestinal model, which indicated that the sulfonation metabolism rate of cholesterol could reach 42% under high cholesterol conditions. These findings provided new evidence that the sulfonation metabolic pathway dominated cholesterol metabolism in hypercholesterolemic mice and microbial conversion of cholesterol-to-CHS was of vital importance for cholesterol-lowering by <i>Bacteroides</i>. This suggested that the gut microbiota could regulate cholesterol metabolism and that it was feasible to reduce cholesterol levels by dietary interventions involving the gut microbiota.",39238326

The link between gut microbiota and glioma is becoming more studied. The goal of this study was to look at the relationships between intestinal flora and glioblastoma, and to provide a new perspective for the diagnosis as well as treatment of glioblastoma. Fecal samples from 80 participants with glioblastoma (n=40) and healthy individuals (n=40) in this study were collected as well as analyzed utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in order to characterize the gut microbial community. Each group has its own microbial community, and the microbial environment of glioblastoma patients had lower richness and evenness. The structure of gut microbiota community in glioblastoma patients showed profound changes, which includes the increase of pathogens in Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and the reduction of probiotic bacteria in Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Meanwhile, the significant correlations and clustering of OTUS (operational taxonomic units) in glioblastoma patients were discovered, and a biomarker panel (Fusobacterium, Escherichia/Shigella, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Lachnospira, Akkermansia, Parasutterella) had been used to discriminate the patients with glioblastoma from the healthy subjects (AUC: 0.80). Furthermore, the glioblastoma group exhibited multiple disturbed pathways through KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, particularly in genetic information processing. Moreover, the prediction of phenotypic characteristics of microbiome proposed that the glioblastoma patients might have more Gram-negative bacteria and opportunistic pathogens than the healthy controls. When compared to healthy people, glioblastoma sufferers have a different host-microbe interaction. Furthermore, certain types of intestinal flora could be regarded as biomarkers and drug targets for the diagnosis as well as treatment of glioblastomas.",39208963

Dysbiosis of the skin microbiome has been implicated in Pso, yet a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of host-microbe interactions is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we conducted an exploratory study by adopting the integrated approach that combines whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing with skin transcriptomics. This was a cross-sectional study, adult patients with plaque-type Psoriasis (Pso) and healthy volunteers were included. Skin microbiota samples and biopsies were collected from both lesional and non-lesional skin areas on the lower back. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was employed for co-expression network analysis, and cell deconvolution was conducted to estimate cell fractions. Taxonomic and functional features of the microbiome were identified using whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Association between host genes and microbes was analyzed using Spearman correlation. Host anti-viral responses and interferon-related networks were identified and correlated with the severity of psoriasis. The skin microbiome showed a greater prevalence of Corynebacterium simulans in the PASI severe-moderate groups, which correlated with interferon-induced host genes. Two distinct psoriatic clusters with varying disease severities were identified. Variations in the expression of cell apoptosis-associated antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and microbial aerobic respiration I pathway may partly account for these differences in disease severity. Our multi-omics analysis revealed for the first time anti-viral responses and the presence of C.simulans associated with psoriasis severity. It also identified two psoriatic subtypes with distinct AMP and metabolic pathway expression. Our study provides new insights into understanding the host-microbe interaction in psoriasis and lays the groundwork for developing subtype-specific strategies for managing this chronic skin disease.

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Tissue-specific overexpression of systemic RNA interference components limits lifespan in C. elegans.,"Intertissue RNA transport recently emerged as a novel signaling mechanism. In mammals, mounting evidence suggests that small RNA transfer between cells is widespread and used in various physiological contexts. In the nematode C. elegans, a similar mechanism is conferred by the systemic RNAi pathway. Members of the Systemic RNA Interference Defective (SID) family act at different steps of cellular RNA uptake and export. The limiting step in systemic RNA interference (RNAi) is the import of extracellular RNAs via the conserved double-stranded (dsRNA)-gated dsRNA channel SID-1. To better understand the role of RNAs as intertissue signaling molecules, we modified the function of SID-1 in specific tissues of C. elegans. We observed that sid-1 loss-of-function mutants are as healthy as wild-type worms. Conversely, overexpression of sid-1 in C. elegans intestine, muscle, or neurons rendered worms short-lived. The effects of intestinal sid-1 overexpression were attenuated by silencing the components of systemic RNAi sid-1, sid-2 and sid-5, implicating systemic RNA signaling in the lifespan reduction. Accordingly, tissue-specific overexpression of sid-2 and sid-5 also reduced worm lifespan. Additionally, an RNAi screen for components of several non-coding RNA pathways revealed that silencing the miRNA biogenesis proteins PASH-1 and DCR-1 rendered the lifespan of worms with intestinal sid-1 overexpression similar to controls. Collectively, our data support the notion that systemic RNA signaling must be tightly regulated, and unbalancing that process provokes a reduction in lifespan.

The role of the microbiome in the ongoing rise of early-onset colorectal cancer is unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate age-related differences in the gut microbiome of patients with colorectal cancer and healthy individuals by examining both the fecal and tumor microbiomes. We utilized the publicly accessible data on fecal shotgun metagenomics from CuratedMetagenomeData and TCGA via the GDC Data Portal. Comparison of 701 colorectal cancer and 693 controls revealed that microbial features were age dependent, with a significant difference in species enrichment between early-onset (<50 years) and late-onset (>65 years) patients with colorectal cancer. Analysis of the tumor-associated microbiome in a separate dataset of 85 patients with colorectal cancer verified age-specific differences in taxon abundance between early- and late-onset patients with colorectal cancer. Finally, using host gene expression data, we found a stronger microbe-host interaction in early- vs. late-onset colorectal cancers. Altogether, these findings indicate that microbial features were age-dependent with stronger microbial-host interactions at the tumor site in early-onset colorectal cancers, suggesting a direct role of microbes in tumorigenesis via interaction with cancer-related pathways in this age group. Early-onset colorectal cancer is on the rise, presumably because of changes in environmental exposures. Lifestyle changes may contribute to colorectal cancer via alterations in gut microbes.

In this study, BM samples from 100 healthy women collected during 15 d after birth were included. BM microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and cytokine and adipokine levels were measured by the Luminex approach. In addition, infant weight and length were recorded during the first 12 months and <i>z</i>-scores were obtained according to the WHO databases. Infants were classified as risk of overweight (ROW) and no-risk of overweight (NOROW) based on their body mass index <i>z</i>-score (BMIZ) and infant weight-for-length <i>z</i>-score (WLZ) at 12 months. In order to study host-microbe interactions, epithelial intestinal and mammary cell lines were exposed to milk microbes to assess the host response by interleukin (IL)-6 production as a potential inflammatory marker. BM was dominated by <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> genera, and the most abundant cytokines were IL-6 and IL-18. Leptin levels were positively correlated with the pregestational body mass index (BMI). Higher relative abundance of the <i>Streptococcus</i> genus was associated with higher IL-10 and higher relative abundance of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus was associated with lower IL-6 concentrations in milk. Infant WLZ at 12 months could be partially predicted by <i>Streptococcus</i> genus proportions and IL-10 and IL-18 levels in BM. BM microbiota significantly induced cytokine responses in mammary epithelial cells. Higher levels of IL-6 production were observed in mammary cells exposed to BM microbiota from mothers with ROW offspring compared to mothers with NOROW offspring. In conclusion, BM microbiota is related to the cytokine profile. IL-10 and IL-18 levels and the abundance of the <i>Streptococcus</i> genus could affect early infant development.

Currently, patients with cholestasis face several obstacles in seeking diagnosis and therapy. Da-Huang-Xiao-Shi decoction (DHXSD) is an ancient classic formula that has been used clinically for cholestasis treatment. Nevertheless, the underlying biological activities and therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, an alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced cholestasis rat model was established to examine the anticholestatic effects of DHXSD using histopathological and molecular analyses. Transcriptomic analysis combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis was systematically applied to study the mechanism of action of DHXSD. Simultaneously, the effect of DHXSD on gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and intestinal barrier function were evaluated based on the ANIT-induced cholestasis model in rats. The results showed that DHXSD effectively attenuated ANIT-induced cholestasis by reducing liver function indicators (alanine transaminase [ALT], <i>P</i> < 0.05; alkaline phosphatase [ALP], <i>P</i> < 0.05; total bile acid [TBA], <i>P</i> < 0.01; -glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and levels of hepatotoxicity-related enzymes (<i>P</i> < 0.05), thus improving the recovery of histopathological injuries, and regulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis combined with intestinal barrier function analysis revealed that the DHXSD significantly ameliorated ANIT-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. Significantly altered genes in the model and treatment groups were screened using transcriptomic analysis. Sixty-eight genes and four microbial genera were simultaneously altered with opposing trends in variation after ANIT and DHXSD treatments. We built a framework for predicting targets and host-microbe interaction mechanisms, as well as identifying alternative treatment for cholestasis, which should be validated further for clinical application. In conclusion, DHXSD appears to be a promising agent for protection against liver injury. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Cholestasis is a serious manifestation of liver diseases resulting in liver injury, fibrosis, and liver failure with limited therapies. To date, only ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cholestasis. However, approximately one-third of patients with cholestasis are unresponsive to UDCA.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 family nuclear receptors are liganded transcription factors that are critical for the development and function of multiple digestive organs in vertebrates, including the intestinal epithelium. Zebrafish have 3 hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 homologs, of which, hnf4a was previously shown to mediate intestinal responses to microbiota in zebrafish larvae. To discern the functions of other hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 family members in zebrafish development and intestinal function, we created and characterized mutations in hnf4g and hnf4b. We addressed the possibility of genetic redundancy amongst these factors by creating double and triple mutants which showed different rates of survival, including apparent early lethality in hnf4a; hnf4b double mutants and triple mutants. RNA sequencing performed on digestive tracts from single and double mutant larvae revealed extensive changes in intestinal gene expression in hnf4a mutants that were amplified in hnf4a; hnf4g mutants, but limited in hnf4g mutants. Changes in hnf4a and hnf4a; hnf4g mutants were reminiscent of those seen in mice including decreased expression of genes involved in intestinal function and increased expression of cell proliferation genes, and were validated using transgenic reporters and EdU labeling in the intestinal epithelium. Gnotobiotics combined with RNA sequencing also showed hnf4g has subtler roles than hnf4a in host responses to microbiota. Overall, phenotypic changes in hnf4a single mutants were strongly enhanced in hnf4a; hnf4g double mutants, suggesting a conserved partial genetic redundancy between hnf4a and hnf4g in the vertebrate intestine.",36218393
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Ruminal background of predisposed milk urea (MU) concentration in Holsteins.,"Efforts to reduce nitrogen (N) emissions are currently based on the optimization of dietary- N supply at average herd N requirements. The implementation of the considerable individual differences and predispositions in N- use efficiency and N- excretion in breeding programs is hampered by the difficulty of data collection. Cow individual milk urea (MU) concentration has been proposed as an easy-to-measure surrogate trait, but recent studies questioned its predictive power. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying predisposed higher (HMUg) or lower (LMUg) MU concentration in dairy cows is needed. Considering the complex N- metabolism in ruminants, the distinction between HMUg and LMUg could be based on differences in (i) the rumen microbial community, (ii) the host-specific transcription processes in the rumen villi, and (iii) the host-microbe interaction in the rumen. Therefore, rumen fluid and rumen epithelial samples from 10 HMUg and 10 LMUg cows were analyzed by 16S sequencing and HiSeq sequencing. In addition, the effect of dietary-N reduction on ruminal shifts was investigated in a second step. In total, 10 differentially abundant genera (DAG) were identified between HMUg and LMUg cows, elucidating greater abundances of ureolytic <i>Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>_<i>unclassified</i> in LMUg animals and enhanced occurrences of <i>Butyvibrio</i> in HMUg cows. Differential expression analysis revealed genes of the bovine Major Histocompatibility Complex (<i>BOLA</i> genes) as well as <i>MX1, ISG15</i>, and <i>PRSS2</i> displaying candidates of MU predisposition that further attributed to enhanced immune system activities in LMUg cows. A number of significant correlations between microbial genera and host transcript abundances were uncovered, including strikingly positive correlations of <i>BOLA-DRA</i> transcripts with <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Lachnospiracea</i>e family abundances that might constitute particularly prominent microbial-host interplays of MU predisposition. The reduction of feed-N was followed by 18 DAG in HMUg and 19 DAG in LMUg, depicting pronounced interest on <i>Shuttleworthia</i>, which displayed controversial adaption in HMUg and LMUg cows. Lowering feed-N further elicited massive downregulation of immune response and energy metabolism pathways in LMUg. Considering breeding selection strategies, this study attributed information content to MU about predisposed ruminal N-utilization in Holstein-Friesians.",36177471
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Two-component systems regulate bacterial virulence in response to the host gastrointestinal environment and metabolic cues.,"Two-component systems are ubiquitous signaling mechanisms in bacteria that enable intracellular changes from extracellular cues. These bacterial regulatory systems couple external stimuli to control genetic expression via an autophosphorylation cascade that transduces membrane signals to intracellular locations, thereby allowing bacteria to rapidly adapt to the changing environmental conditions. Well known to control basic cellular processes, it is evident that two-component systems also exercise control over virulence traits, such as motility, secretion systems, and stress responses that impact the complex cascade of networks that alter virulence traits. In the gastrointestinal system, cues for activation of virulence-related two-component systems include metal ions, host-derived metabolites, and gut conditions. The diversity and origin of these cues suggest that the host can exert control over enteric pathogenicity via regulation in the gastrointestinal system. With the rise in multi-drug resistant pathogens, the potential control of pathogenicity with host cues via two-component systems presents a potential alternative to antimicrobials. Though the signaling mechanism itself is well studied, to date there is no systematic review compiling the host-associated cues of two-component systems and virulence traits. This review highlights the direct link between the host gastrointestinal environment and pathogenicity by focusing on two-component systems that are associated with the genetic expression of virulence traits, and that are activated by host-derived cues. The direct link between the host gastrointestinal environment, metabolites, and pathogenicity established in this review both underscores the importance of host-derived cues on bacterial activity and presents an enticing therapeutic target in the fight against antimicrobial resistant pathogens.",36128741

Siglecs are expressed on various leukocyte types and are involved in diverse aspects of immunity, including the regulation of inflammatory responses, leukocyte proliferation, host-microbe interaction, and cancer immunity. Sialoadhesin/Siglec-1, CD22/Siglec-2, and myelin-associated glycoprotein/Siglec-4 were among the first to be characterized as members of the Siglec family, and along with Siglec-15, they are relatively well-conserved among tetrapods. Conversely, CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs (CD33rSiglecs, so named as they show high sequence similarity with CD33/Siglec-3) are encoded in a gene cluster with many interspecies variations and even intraspecies variations within some lineages such as humans. The rapid evolution of CD33rSiglecs expressed on leukocytes involved in innate immunity likely reflects the selective pressure by pathogens that interact and possibly exploit these Siglecs. Human Siglecs have several additional unique and/or polymorphic properties as compared with closely related great apes, changes possibly related to the loss of the sialic acid Neu5Gc, another distinctly human event in sialobiology. Multiple changes in human CD33rSiglecs compared to great apes include many examples of human-specific expression in non-immune cells, coinciding with human-specific diseases involving such cell types.

Difficulties in culturing tubeworms and their symbionts in a laboratory setting have hindered the study of host-microbe interactions. Therefore, released symbiont genomes are fragmented, thereby limiting the data available on the genome that affect subsequent analyses. Here, we present a complete genome of gammaproteobacterial endosymbiont from the tubeworm Lamellibrachia satsuma collected from a seep in Kagoshima Bay, assembled using a hybrid approach that combines sequences generated from the Illumina and Oxford Nano-pore platforms.

An in vitro static simulation of the human colon was used in this work to analyze the evolution of bacterial populations, the microbial metabolic output, and the potential induction of AhR transcriptional activity in healthy gut ecosystems. Fifteen target taxa were explored by qPCR, and the metabolic content was chromatographically profiled using SPME-GC-MS and UPLC-FLD to quantify short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and biogenic amines, respectively. Over 72 h of fermentation, the microbiota and most produced metabolites remained stable. Fermentation supernatant induced AhR transcription in two of the three reporter gene cell lines (T47D, HepG2, HT29) evaluated. Mammary and intestinal cells were more sensitive to microbiota metabolic production, which showed greater AhR agonism than the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) used as a positive control.

A total of 18 female Tibetan goat kids (<i>n</i>=9) were weaned from their mothers at 28d (D28) and 60d (D60) postpartum. D60 and D28 groups were fed the same solid diet ad libitum from weaning to 75d of age. The colonic epithelium was subject to RNA-sequencing, the caecal digesta metabolomics were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the caecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We found that early weaning substantially increased the colonic pro-apoptotic gene expression of B-cell lymphoma associated X (<i>Bax</i>), caspase-9, and caspase-3, and decreased the expression of zonula occludens-1 (<i>ZO-1</i>) and claudin-1 (<i>P</i><0.01). In addition, a significant <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i> enrichment was observed in the hindgut of early-weaned goats (<i>P</i><0.01), which negatively correlated with lysophosphatidylcholine products. Similarly, the chemokine signaling, <i>IL-17</i> signaling, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (<i>PPAR</i>) signaling pathways were upregulated in the colonic mucosa of the early-weaned goats. By applying caecal microbiota transplantation from goats to defaunated C57/6J mice, we confirmed that caecal microbiota of D28 goat kids increased the relative abundance of <i>B.acidifaciens</i> and significantly up-regulated the genes of <i>Bax</i>, G protein-coupled receptor (<i>GPR</i>) <i>109A</i>, <i>GPR 43</i>, fatty acid binding protein 6, nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and <i>IL-6</i> expression (<i>P</i><0.05), and decreased <i>ZO-1</i>, and claudin-1 protein expression in the mice jejunum and colon (<i>P</i><0.001). These results proposed that the hindgut microbiota and metabolites mediate the barrier function weakening during early weaning, and the relative abundance of <i>B.acidifaciens</i> was negatively correlated with the hindgut barrier gene expression. This study demonstrates how weaning stress can affect key host-microbe interaction regulators in the hindgut, in a lysophosphatidylcholine dependent and independent manner.

Here, we investigated the impact of sublethal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration on gene expression of <i>E. coli</i> BW25113 after 10 and 60 min of exposure. RNA-seq analysis revealed that approximately 12% of bacterial genes were strongly dysregulated 10 min following exposure to 2.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure led to the activation of a specific antioxidant response and a general stress response. The latter was characterized by a transient down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism, such as nucleic acid biosynthesis and translation, with a striking and coordinated down-regulation of genes involved in ribosome formation, and a sustained up-regulation of the SOS response. We confirmed the rapid transient and specific response mediated by the transcription factor OxyR leading to up-regulation of antioxidant systems, including the catalase-encoding gene (<i>katG</i>), that rapidly degrade extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and promote bacterial survival. We documented a strong and transient up-regulation of genes involved in sulfur metabolism and cysteine biosynthesis, which are under the control of the transcription factor CysB.

Following season-specific FMT, the microbiota of the mouse model resembled that of the donor, and mice transplanted with the microbiota from the shoot-eating season grew faster and stored more fat.

Invasion success is dependent on interactions among living organisms, but their study has been mostly limited to negative interactions while positive interactions are mostly underlooked. Recent studies suggested that microorganisms associated with eukaryotic hosts may play a determinant role in the invasion process. Along with the knowledge of their structure, taxonomic composition, and potential functional profile, understanding how bacterial communities are associated with the invasive species and the threatened natives (species-specific/environmentally shaped/tissue-specific) can give us a holistic insight into the invasion mechanisms. Here, we aimed to compare the bacterial communities associated with leaves and roots of two native Caribbean seagrasses (<i>Halodule wrightii</i> and <i>Thalassia testudinum</i>) with those of the successful invader <i>Halophila stipulacea</i>, in the Caribbean island Curaao, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and functional prediction. Invasive seagrass microbiomes were more diverse and included three times more species-specific core OTUs than the natives. Associated bacterial communities were seagrass-specific, with higher similarities between natives than between invasive and native seagrasses for both communities associated with leaves and roots, despite their strong tissue differentiation. However, with a higher number of OTUs in common, the core community (i.e., OTUs occurring in at least 80% of the samples) of the native <i>H. wrightii</i> was more similar to that of the invader <i>H. stipulacea</i> than <i>T. testudinum</i>, which could reflect more similar essential needs (e.g., nutritional, adaptive, and physiological) between native and invasive, in contrast to the two natives that might share more environment-related OTUs. Relative to native seagrass species, the invasive <i>H. stipulacea</i> was enriched in halotolerant bacterial genera with plant growth-promoting properties (like <i>Halomonas</i> sp. and <i>Lysinibacillus</i> sp.) and other potential beneficial effects for hosts (e.g., heavy metal detoxifiers and quorum sensing inhibitors). Predicted functional profiles also revealed some advantageous traits on the invasive species such as detoxification pathways, protection against pathogens, and stress tolerance. Despite the predictive nature of our findings concerning the functional potential of the bacteria, this investigation provides novel and important insights into native vs. invasive seagrasses microbiome. We demonstrated that the bacterial community associated with the invasive seagrass <i>H. stipulacea</i> is different from native seagrasses, including some potentially beneficial bacteria, suggesting the importance of considering the microbiome dynamics as a possible and important influencing factor in the colonization of non-indigenous species. We suggest further comparison of <i>H. stipulacea</i> microbiome from its native range with that from both the Mediterranean and Caribbean habitats where this species has a contrasting invasion success.

Colonic tissues and fecal samples were collected in a time-serial mode and analyzed by gene microarray and 16S rRNA sequencing. Intraepithelial bacteria were isolated using a gentamicin resistance assay, and challenged in epithelial cultures. Our study showed that antibiotic treatment at midphase but not early or late phase reduced mouse tumor burden, suggesting a time-specific host-microbe interplay. A unique antimicrobial transcriptome profile showing an inverse relationship between autophagy and oxidative stress genes was correlated with a transient surge in microbial diversity and virulence emergence in mouse stool during cancer initiation. Gavage with fimA/fimH/htrA-expressing invasive Escherichia coli isolated from colonocytes increased tumor burden in recipient mice, whereas inoculation of bacteria deleted of htrA or triple genes did not. The invasive E.coli suppressed epithelial autophagy activity through reduction of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 transcripts and caused dual oxidase 2-dependent free radical overproduction and tumor cell hyperproliferation. A novel alternating spheroid culture model was developed for sequential bacterial challenge to address the long-term changes in host-microbe interaction for chronic tumor growth. Epithelial cells with single bacterial encounter showed a reduction in transcript levels of autophagy genes while those sequentially challenged with invasive E.coli showed heightened autophagy gene expression to eliminate intracellular microbes, implicating that bacteria-dependent cell hyperproliferation could be terminated at late phases. Finally, the presence of bacterial htrA and altered antimicrobial gene expression were observed in human colorectal cancer specimens. Invasive pathobionts contribute to cancer initiation during a key time frame by counterbalancing autophagy and oxidative stress in the colonic epithelium.

Early-divergent phyla like sponges (Porifera) can help to identify the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of immune signaling. We characterized both the expressed immune gene repertoire and the induced response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in <i>Halichondria panicea</i>, a promising model for sponge symbioses. We exposed sponges under controlled experimental conditions to bacterial LPS and performed RNA-seq on samples taken 1h and 6h after exposure. <i>H. panicea</i> possesses a diverse array of putative PRRs. While part of those PRRs was constitutively expressed in all analyzed sponges, the majority was expressed individual-specific and regardless of LPS treatment or timepoint. The induced immune response by LPS involved differential regulation of genes related to signaling and recognition, more specifically GTPases and post-translational regulation mechanisms like ubiquitination and phosphorylation. We have discovered individuality in both the immune receptor repertoire and the response to LPS, which may translate into holobiont fitness and susceptibility to stress. The three different layers of immune gene control observed in this study, - namely constitutive expression, individual-specific expression, and induced genes -, draw a complex picture of the innate immune gene regulation in <i>H. panicea</i>.

Although the pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear, previous research has provided evidence for complex interplays between genetic, immune, microbial, and environmental factors. Here, we constructed a gene-microbiota interaction-based framework to discover IBD biomarkers and therapeutics. <b>Methods:</b> We identified candidate biomarkers for IBD by analyzing the publicly available transcriptomic and microbiome data from IBD cohorts. Animal models of IBD and diarrhea were established. The inflammation-correlated microbial and genetic variants in gene knockout mice were identified by 16S rRNA sequences and PCR array. We performed bioinformatic analysis of microbiome functional prediction and drug repurposing. Our validation experiments with cells and animals confirmed anti-inflammatory properties of a drug candidate. <b>Results:</b> We identified the DNA-sensing enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) as a potential biomarker for IBD in both patients and murine models. cGAS knockout mice were less susceptible to DSS-induced colitis. cGAS-associated gut microbiota and host genetic factors relating to IBD pathogenesis were also identified. Using a computational drug repurposing approach, we predicted 43 candidate drugs with high potency to reverse colitis-associated gene expression and validated that brefeldin-a mitigates inflammatory response in colitis mouse model and colon cancer cell lines. <b>Conclusions:</b> By integrating computational screening, microbiota interference, gene knockout techniques, and <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> validation, we built a framework for predicting biomarkers and host-microbe interaction targets and identifying repurposing drugs for IBD, which may be tested further for clinical application. This approach may also be a tool for repurposing drugs for treating other diseases.",34158863

Despite such an importance, very little is known about duckweed-microbe interactions that would be a key biological factor for efficient industrial utilization of duckweeds. Here we first report the duckweed growth promoting ability of bacterial strains belonging to the phylum <i>Acidobacteria</i>, the members of which are known to inhabit soils and terrestrial plants, but their ecological roles and plant-microbe interactions remain largely unclear. Two novel <i>Acidobacteria</i> strains, F-183 and TBR-22, were successfully isolated from wild duckweeds and phylogenetically affiliated with subdivision 3 and 6 of the phylum, respectively, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. In the co-culture experiments with aseptic host plants, the F-183 and TBR-22 strains visibly enhanced growth (frond number) of six duckweed species (subfamily <i>Lemnoideae</i>) up to 1.8-5.1 times and 1.6-3.9 times, respectively, compared with uninoculated controls. Intriguingly, both strains also increased the chlorophyll content of the duckweed (<i>Lemna aequinoctialis</i>) up to 2.4-2.5 times. Under SEM observation, the F-183 and TBR-22 strains were epiphytic and attached to the surface of duckweed.

However, testing and optimizing these strategies using controlled experiments at large spatiotemporal scales are logistically challenging. Mathematical models provide an alternative investigative tool, and many have been developed to explore resistance deployment strategies under various contexts. This review analyzes 69 modeling studies in light of specific model structures (e.g., demographic or demogenetic, spatial or not), underlying assumptions (e.g., whether preadapted pathogens are present before resistance deployment), and evaluation criteria (e.g., resistance durability, disease control, cost-effectiveness).

Here, we asked how these small regulators are regulated using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a model system. Among the best-studied sRNAs in this plant pathogen are AbcR1 regulating numerous ABC transporters and PmaR, a regulator of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, motility, and ampicillin resistance. We report that the LysR-type regulator VtlR (also known as LsrB) controls expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. A vtlR/lsrB deletion strain showed growth defects, was sensitive to antibiotics and severely compromised in plant tumor formation. Transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed more than 1,200 genes with altered expression in the mutant. Consistent with the function of VtlR/LsrB as regulator of AbcR1, many ABC transporter genes were affected. Interestingly, the transcription factor did not only control the expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. In the mutant, 102 sRNA genes were significantly up- or downregulated. Thus, our study uncovered VtlR/LsrB as the master regulator of numerous sRNAs.

This study focuses on describing the natural product genetic potential as well as the expressed natural product molecules in benthic tropical cyanobacteria. We collected from several sites around the world and sequenced the genomes of 24 tropical filamentous marine cyanobacteria. The informatics program antiSMASH was used to annotate the major classes of gene clusters. BiG-SCAPE phylum-wide analysis revealed the most promising strains for natural product discovery among these cyanobacteria. LCMS/MS-based metabolomics highlighted the most abundant molecules and molecular classes among 10 of these marine cyanobacterial samples.

Regeneration of host epithelia is normally quiescent upon colonization of commensal bacteria; however, the epithelia often develop dysplasia in a context-dependent manner, the cause and underlying mechanism of which remain unclear. Here, we show that in Drosophila intestine, autophagy lowers the sensitivity of differentiated enterocytes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced in response to commensal bacteria. We find that autophagy deficiency provokes ROS-dependent excessive regeneration and subsequent epithelial dysplasia and barrier dysfunction. Mechanistically, autophagic substrate Ref(2)P/p62, which co-localizes and physically interacts with Dachs, a Hippo signaling regulator, accumulates upon autophagy deficiency and thus inactivates Hippo signaling, resulting in stem cell over-proliferationnon-cell autonomously.

ReA is solely established using differential clinical diagnosis of the patient cohorts, where pathogenic triggers linked to enteric and urogenital microorganisms e.g. Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Chlamydia have been reported. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), an idiopathic enteric disorder co-evolved and attuned to present gut microbiome dysbiosis, can be correlated to the genesis of enteropathic arthropathies like ReA. Gut microbes symbolically modulate immune system homeostasis and are elementary for varied disease patterns in autoimmune disorders. The gut-microbiota axis structured on the core host-microbe interactions execute an imperative role in discerning the etiopathogenesis of ReA and IBD. This study predicts the molecular signatures for ReA with co-evolved IBD through the enveloped host-microbe interactions and microbe-microbe 'interspecies communication', using synonymous gene expression data for selective microbes. We have utilized a combinatorial approach that have concomitant in-silico work-pipeline and experimental validation to corroborate the findings. In-silico analysis involving text mining, metabolic network reconstruction, simulation, filtering, host-microbe interaction, docking and molecular mimicry studies results in robust drug target/s and biomarker/s for co-evolved IBD and ReA. Cross validation of the target/s or biomarker/s was done by targeted gene expression analysis following a non-probabilistic convenience sampling.

In <i>Hydra</i>, formation of the head organizer involves the canonical Wnt pathway. Treatment with alsterpaullone (ALP) results in acquiring characteristics of the head organizer in the body column. Intriguingly, germfree <i>Hydra</i> polyps are significantly more sensitive to ALP compared to control polyps. In addition to microbes, -catenin-dependent pattern formation is also affected by temperature. Gene expression analyses led to the identification of two small secreted peptides, named Eco1 and Eco2, being up-regulated in the response to both <i>Curvibacter</i> sp., the main bacterial colonizer of <i>Hydra</i>, and low temperatures.

Theoretical and experimental studies show that vertical transmission of symbionts leads to the evolution of mutualistic traits, whereas horizontal transmission facilitates the emergence of parasitic features. However, these studies focused on phenotypic data, and we know little about underlying molecular changes at the genomic level. Here, we combined an experimental evolution approach with infection assays, genome resequencing, and global gene expression analysis to study the effect of transmission mode on an obligate intracellular bacterial symbiont. We show that a dramatic shift in the frequency of genetic variants, coupled with major changes in gene expression, allow the symbiont to alter its position in the parasitism-mutualism continuum depending on the mode of between-host transmission. We found that increased parasitism in horizontally transmitted chlamydiae residing in amoebae was a result of processes occurring at the infectious stage of the symbiont's developmental cycle. Specifically, genes involved in energy production required for extracellular survival and the type III secretion system-the symbiont's primary virulence mechanism-were significantly up-regulated.

Twelve polymorphisms in <i>IL-1</i> gene cluster, <i>IL-6</i> and its receptor, <i>IL-10</i>, <i>IL-17A</i>, and <i>IL-18</i> were determined in 91 AgP patients and 210 controls. Analysis of seven selected periodontal bacteria in subgingival sulci/pockets was performed with a commercial DNA-microarray kit in a subgroup of 76 individuals. The pilot in vitro study included stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) from 20 individuals with periodontal bacteria and measurement of IL-10 levels using the Luminex method.

The N. lugens gene NlCYP4CE1 encodes cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450), which is a key enzyme in the metabolism of the insecticide imidacloprid. Previous research has suggested that the expression of NlCYP4CE1 is induced by imidacloprid stress, but the effect of bacterial symbionts on its expression has not been determined. The results of this study show that exposure to subtoxic imidacloprid changed the structure of the bacterial symbiont community in N. lugens. Specifically, the total bacterial content increased, but the bacterial species diversity significantly decreased. Wolbachia accounted for the largest proportion of bacteria in N. lugens; its abundance significantly increased after subtoxic imidacloprid exposure. The transcript level of NlCYP4CE1 was significantly increased by imidacloprid, but this effect was significantly weakened after Wolbachia was cleared with tetracycline. This result suggests that Wolbachia enhances the expression of NlCYP4CE1 to promote the detoxification metabolic response to imidacloprid stress. Understanding the effect of bacterial symbionts on gene expression in the host provides a new perspective on interactions between insecticides and their target insect pests, and highlights that subtoxic imidacloprid exposure may raise the risk of insecticide resistance by altering the structure of bacterial symbiont communities.",32519810

For a proof-of-concept, we studied a model plant-soil system and employed a non-deterministic gene-centric approach. A holistic analysis was performed using plants of two species and irrigation with water of low quality to induce host stress. Our analyses examined the genetic potential (DNA) and gene expression patterns (RNA) of plant-associated microbial communities, as well as transcriptional profiling of host plants. Transcriptional analysis of plants irrigated with treated wastewater revealed significant enrichment of general stress-associated root transcripts relative to plants irrigated with fresh water. Metagenomic analysis of root-associated microbial communities in treated wastewater-irrigated plants, however, revealed enrichment of more specific stress-associated genes relating to high levels of salt, high pH and lower levels of oxygen. Meta-analysis of these differentially abundant genes obtained from other metagenome studies, provided evidence of the link between environmental factors such as pH and oxygen and these genes. Analysis of microbial transcriptional response demonstrated that enriched gene content was actively expressed, which implies contemporary response to elevated levels of pH and salt. We demonstrate here that microbial profiling can elucidate stress signals that cannot be observed even through interrogation of host transcriptome, leading to an alternate mechanism for evaluating in situ conditions experienced by host organisms. This study is a proof-of-concept for the use of microbial communities as microsensors, with great potential for interrogation of a wide range of host systems. Video Abstract.",32438915

In this study, the adhesive and biofilm forming properties of ten clinical and ten commensal S. haemolyticus strains were examined using standard adhesion and biofilm assays. One of the clinical strains was used to identify expressed surface proteins using bacterial surface shaving. Protein abundance was examined by a comparative analysis between bacterial protein expression after human keratinocyte (HaCaT) colonization and growth in cell culture media supplemented with serum. Relative protein quantification was performed by labeling peptides with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to Mass Spectrometry analysis. Surface proteins can be used as novel targets for antimicrobial treatment and in diagnostics. Adherence to fibronectin, collagen and plastic was low in all tested strains, but with significantly higher adhesion to fibronectin (p=0.041) and collagen (p=0.001) in the commensal strains. There was a trend towards higher degree of biofilm formation in the clinical strains (p=0.059). By using surface shaving, 325 proteins were detected, of which 65 were classified as surface proteins. Analyses showed that the abundance of nineteen (5.8%) proteins were significantly changed following HaCaT colonization. The bacterial Toll/interleukin-1 like (TIRs) domain containing protein (p=0.04), the transglycosylase SceD (p=0.01), and the bifunctional autolysin Atl (p=0.04) showed a 1.4, 1.6- and 1.5-fold increased abundance.

The functionality of CwaS/R proteins as a TCS has been demonstrated by biochemical analysis. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes of the PG biosynthesis. Analysis of the muropeptides of PG in mutants allowed us to re-annotate LSEI_0221 as a putative L,D-carboxypeptidase (LdcA). The absence of this protein coincided with a decrease of two surface antigens: LSEI_0020, corresponding to p40 or msp2 whose implication in the host epithelial homeostasis has been recently studied, and LSEI_2029 which has never been functionally characterized.

To understand this mechanism of host-microbe interaction, we attempted to characterize the role of transferrin in bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana) during bacterial transmission. qPCR analysis showed that Tf was exclusively expressed in the outer layer of ANG,and this was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which showed that Tf was localized in the outer epithelial cell layer of the ANG. Western blot analysis indicated that TF is a soluble glycoprotein. Immunohistochemical staining also showed that TF is localized in the outer epithelial cell layer of the ANG and that it is mainly expressed in the outer layer during ANG growth.

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Persistent peripheral presence of Staphylococcus aureus promotes histone H3 hypoacetylation and decreases tyrosine hydroxylase protein level in rat brain tissues.,"Growing evidences suggest systemic pathogen-induced neuroimmune interaction is a major risk factor for several neurological disorders. Our goal was to investigate whether asymptomatic peripheral carriage of Staphylococcus aureus, a widespread opportunistic pathogen, could modulate selective molecular features in brain tissues. To address this, a peripheral infection model was developed by challenging Wistar rats repeatedly with a clinical strain of S. aureus. Animals infected with S. aureus (10 CFU for three times in 10 days) showed significant changes in acetylation profile of selective lysine (K) residues K9 (H3K9), K14 (H3K14) and K27 (H3K27) of histone H3 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Although S. aureus was restricted peripherally, the infection induced hypoacetylation of H3K9, H3K14 and H3K27 in the hippocampus and H3K27 in the PFC. Histone H3 hypoacetylation in the hippocampus and PFC was also detected when rats were challenged with an engineered invasive strain of E. coli K12, SK3842. This confirmed that modulation of epigenetic landscape in distal brain tissues may not be specific to S. aureus. Moreover, the tyrosine hydroxylase protein, the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis pathway whose gene-expression is regulated by H3 acetylation at the promoter, was remarkably reduced in the brain tissues of the infected hosts. The results indicate that commensals like S. aureus, in spite of being largely restricted to the peripheral tissues, could modulate the homeostasis of molecular features in brain tissues whose maintenance is critical for preserving normal neurological functions.",31503205

NTHi adheres to and invades host respiratory epithelial cells as a means to persist in the lower airways of adults with COPD. Therefore, we mined the genomes of NTHi strains isolated from the airways of adults with COPD to identify novel proteins to investigate their role in adherence and invasion of human respiratory epithelial cells. An isogenic knockout mutant of the open reading frame <i>NTHI1441</i> showed a 76.6%5.5% reduction in invasion of human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells at 1, 3, and 6h postinfection. Decreased invasion of the <i>NTHI1441</i> mutant was independent of either intracellular survival or adherence to cells. <i>NTHI1441</i> is conserved among NTHi genomes. Results of whole-bacterial-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry experiments identified that NTHI1441 has epitopes expressed on the bacterial cell surface. Adults with COPD develop increased serum IgG against NTHI1441 after experiencing an exacerbation with NTHi. This study reveals NTHI1441 as a novel NTHi virulence factor expressed during infection of the COPD lower airways that contributes to invasion of host respiratory epithelial cells. The role in host cell invasion, conservation among strains, and expression of surface-exposed epitopes suggest that NTHI1441 is a potential target for preventative and therapeutic interventions for disease caused by NTHi.",31427451
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""","Codon Usage Heterogeneity in the Multipartite Prokaryote Genome: Selection-Based Coding Bias Associated with Gene Location, Expression Level, and Ancestry.","Prokaryotes represent an ancestral lineage in the tree of life and constitute optimal resources for investigating the evolution of genomes in unicellular organisms. Many bacterial species possess multipartite genomes offering opportunities to study functional variations among replicons, how and where new genes integrate into a genome, and how genetic information within a lineage becomes encoded and evolves. To analyze these issues, we focused on the model soil bacterium <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i>, which harbors a chromosome, a chromid (pSymB), a megaplasmid (pSymA), and, in many strains, one or more accessory plasmids. The analysis of several genomes, together with 1.4Mb of accessory plasmid DNA that we purified and sequenced, revealed clearly different functional profiles associated with each genomic entity. pSymA, in particular, exhibited remarkable interstrain variation and a high density of singletons (unique, exclusive genes) featuring functionalities and modal codon usages that were very similar to those of the plasmidome. All this evidence reinforces the idea of a close relationship between pSymA and the plasmidome. Correspondence analyses revealed that adaptation of codon usages to the translational machinery increased from plasmidome to pSymA to pSymB to chromosome, corresponding as such to the ancestry of each replicon in the lineage. We demonstrated that chromosomal core genes gradually adapted to the translational machinery, reminiscent of observations in several bacterial taxa for genes with high expression levels. Such findings indicate a previously undiscovered codon usage adaptation associated with the chromosomal core information that likely operates to improve bacterial fitness. We present a comprehensive model illustrating the central findings described here, discussed in the context of the changes occurring during the evolution of a multipartite prokaryote genome.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacterial genomes usually include many thousands of genes which are expressed with diverse spatial-temporal patterns and intensities. A well-known evidence is that highly expressed genes, such as the ribosomal and other translation-related proteins (RTRPs), have accommodated their codon usage to optimize translation efficiency and accuracy. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identify core-genes sets with different ancestries, and demonstrate that selection processes that optimize codon usage are not restricted to RTRPs but extended at a genome-wide scale. Such findings highlight, for the first time, a previously undiscovered adaptation strategy associated with the chromosomal-core information. Contrasted with the translationally more adapted genes, singletons (i.e., exclusive genes, including those of the plasmidome) appear as the gene pool with the less-ameliorated codon usage in the lineage. A comprehensive summary describing the inter- and intra-replicon heterogeneity of codon usages in a complex prokaryote genome is presented.",31138741

Our aim in this study was to investigate and functionally characterize the secretome of <i>G. adiacens</i>. Proteins in the secretome preparation were digested by trypsin and applied to nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. By using a combined mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approach, we identified 101 proteins. Bioinformatics tools predicting subcellular localization revealed that 18 of the secreted proteins possessed signal sequence. More than 20% of the secretome proteins were putative virulence proteins including serine protease, superoxide dismutase, aminopeptidase, molecular chaperone DnaK, and thioredoxin. Ribosomal proteins, molecular chaperones, and glycolytic enzymes, together known as ""moonlighting proteins,"" comprised fifth of the secretome proteins. By Gene Ontology analysis, more than 60 proteins of the secretome were grouped in biological processes or molecular functions.

Here, Alzheimer disease-associated sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming <i>Clostridium sp</i>. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&A vs 1.3% of healthy American population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&A compared with non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives induce ADAS and tryptamine.

The gene coding for the RNase YbeY belongs to the minimal prokaryotic genome set and has a profound impact on physiology in a wide range of bacteria. Here, we show that the <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i><i>ybeY</i> gene is not essential. Deletion of the gene in the plant pathogen reduced growth, motility, and stress tolerance. Most interestingly, YbeY is crucial for <i>A. tumefaciens</i>-mediated T-DNA transfer and tumor formation. Comparative proteomics by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) revealed dysregulation of 59 proteins, many of which have previously been found to be dependent on the RNA chaperone Hfq. YbeY and Hfq have opposing effects on production of these proteins. Accumulation of a 16S rRNA precursor in the <i>ybeY</i> mutant suggests that <i>A. tumefaciens</i> YbeY is involved in rRNA processing. RNA coimmunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-Seq) showed binding of YbeY to the region immediately upstream of the 16S rRNA. Purified YbeY is an oligomer with RNase activity.

An imbalance between harmful and protective gut bacteria, termed dysbiosis, has been linked to many diseases and has most often been attributed to high-fat dietary intake. However, we recently clarified that the type of fat, not calories, were important in the development of murine colitis. To further understand the host-microbe dynamic in response to dietary lipids, we fed mice isocaloric high-fat diets containing either milk fat, corn oil or olive oil and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the colon microbiome and mass spectrometry-based relative quantification of the colonic metaproteome. The corn oil diet, rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, increased the potential for pathobiont survival and invasion in an inflamed, oxidized and damaged gut while saturated fatty acids promoted compensatory inflammatory responses involved in tissue healing. We conclude that various lipids uniquely alter the host-microbe interaction in the gut. While high-fat consumption has a distinct impact on the gut microbiota, the type of fatty acids alters the relative microbial abundances and predicted functions. These results support that the type of fat are key to understanding the biological effects of high-fat diets on gut health.",30781503

However, most previous studies were based on 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenome sequencing; the viability and functional activity of the microbiome, as well as its interaction with host immune systems, have not been well studied. To characterize the active lung microbiome and its associations with host immune response and clinical features, we applied metatranscriptome sequencing to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 25 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and from nine control cases without known pulmonary disease. Community structure analyses revealed three distinct microbial compositions, which were significantly correlated with bacterial biomass, human Th17 immune response, and COPD exacerbation frequency. Specifically, samples with transcriptionally active <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, or <i>Pseudomonas</i> had bacterial loads 16 times higher than samples enriched for <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Ralstonia</i>. These high-bacterial-load samples also tended to undergo a stronger Th17 immune response. Furthermore, an increased proportion of lymphocytes was found in samples with active <i>Pseudomonas</i>. In addition, COPD patients with active <i>Streptococcus</i> or <i>Rothia</i> infections tended to have lower rates of exacerbations than patients with active <i>Pseudomonas</i> and patients with lower bacterial biomass. Our results support the idea of a stratified structure of the active lung microbiome and a significant host-microbe interaction. We speculate that diverse lung microbiomes exist in the population and that their presence and activities could either influence or reflect different aspects of lung health. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Recent studies of the microbiome proposed that resident microbes play a beneficial role in maintaining human health. Although lower respiratory tract disease is a leading cause of sickness and mortality, how the lung microbiome interacts with human health remains largely unknown. Here we assessed the association between the lung microbiome and host gene expression, cytokine concentration, and over 20 clinical features. Intriguingly, we found a stratified structure of the active lung microbiome which was significantly associated with bacterial biomass, lymphocyte proportion, human Th17 immune response, and COPD exacerbation frequency.

We found that interleukin (IL)-23 and its downstream target IL-22 restricted atherosclerosis by repressing pro-atherogenic microbiota. Inactivation of IL-23-IL-22 signaling led to deterioration of the intestinal barrier, dysbiosis, and expansion of pathogenic bacteria with distinct biosynthetic and metabolic properties, causing systemic increase in pro-atherogenic metabolites such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Augmented disease in the absence of the IL-23-IL-22 pathway was mediated inpart by pro-atherogenic osteopontin, controlled by microbial metabolites. Microbiota transfer from IL-23-deficient mice accelerated atherosclerosis, whereas microbial depletion or IL-22 supplementation reduced inflammation and ameliorated disease. Our work uncovers the IL-23-IL-22 signaling as a regulator of atherosclerosis that restrains expansion of pro-atherogenic microbiota and argues for informed use of cytokine blockers to avoid cardiovascular side effects driven by microbiota and inflammation.",30389414

Autophagy is an important catabolic recycling pathway that degrades long-lived proteins and some organelles by lysosome to maintain cellular homeostasis. Although impaired autophagy is thought to be closely correlated with Crohn's disease (CD), the functional role of autophagy in the maintenance of gut microbiota is poorly understood. As autophagy-related 5 (<i>Atg5</i>) is a key gene associated with the extension of the phagophoric membrane in autophagic vesicles, we established a gut-specific <i>Atg5</i> knockout mouse model, and we found that the disruption of autophagic flux in the intenstinal epithelium cells dramatically altered the composition of the gut microbiota and reduced alpha diversity. Microbial function prediction indicated that the pathway allocated for infectious diseases was enriched in <i>Atg5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. ""<i>Candidatus</i> Arthromitus"" and the <i>Pasteurellaceae</i> family were increased in <i>Atg5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family were reduced. Transcriptome analysis revealed that two key inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related transcription factors, RORC and TBX21, of host cells were upregulated in <i>Atg5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, thus elevating the Muc2-related immunological response. The findings suggest that intestinal autophagy plays a vital role in modulating the diversity and composition of gut microbiota.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The homeostasis of host-microbiota interactions is of great importance to host health. Previous studies demonstrated that disruption of autophagy was linked to inflammatory bowel disease. However, the interaction mechanism of gut microbiota regulated by autophagy was obscure. In an intestinal epithelium-specific autophagy-related 5 (<i>Atg5</i>) knockout mouse model, we observed a significant alteration and decreased diversity in the gut microbiota of <i>Atg5</i>-deficient mice compared with that of wild-type mice. Although the numbers of some organisms (e.g., <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and members of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family) associated with the control of inflammation decreased, those of proinflammationory bacteria (e.g., ""<i>Candidatus</i> Arthromitus"") and potential pathogens (the <i>Pasteurellaceae</i> family) increased in <i>Atg5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that two key genes, <i>RORC</i> and <i>TBX21</i>, involved in inflammatory bowel disease were upregulated in <i>Atg5</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Infections rarely occur in immunocompetent individuals, indicating efficient clearance of conidia by pulmonary defense mechanisms. Other aspergilli like Aspergillus niger also cause infections but to a much lesser extent. Our previous studies showed that A. fumigatus and A. niger have different behavior in the presence of type II alveolar A549 epithelial cells. A. fumigatus conidia are more efficiently internalized by these cells and germination is delayed when compared to A. niger. In addition, hyphae that have escaped the epithelial cells grow parallel to the epithelium, while A. niger grows away from this cell layer. Here it is shown that global gene expression of A. fumigatus and A. niger is markedly different upon contact with A549 cells. A total of 545 and 473 genes of A. fumigatus and A. niger, respectively, were differentially expressed when compared to growth in the absence of A549 cells. Notably, only 53 genes (approximately 10%) were shared in these gene sets. The different response was also illustrated by the fact that only 4 out of 75 GO terms were shared that were enriched in the differentially expressed gene sets. The orthologues of A. fumigatus genes involved in hypoxia regulation and heat shock were also up-regulated in A. niger, whereas thioredoxin reductase and allergen genes were found up-regulated in A. fumigatus but down-regulated in A. niger. Infection with A. fumigatus resulted in only 62 up and 47 down-regulated genes in A549. These numbers were 17 and 34 in the case of A. niger. GO terms related with immune response were down-regulated upon exposure to A. fumigatus but not in the case of A. niger. This indicates that A. fumigatus reprograms A549 to be less immunologically alert. Our dual transcriptomic analysis supports earlier observations of a marked difference in life style between A. fumigatus and A. niger when grown in the presence of type II epithelial cells.

It is hypothesized that the gut-brain axis, which is a network of hierarchical anterior regulatory tissues, contributes largely to variations in FE. Therefore, full-sib pigs with extreme residual feed intake values were assigned to experimental groups of high and low FE. Relevant hormones, minerals, and metabolites including fatty acid profiles were analyzed in serum to assess postprandial conditions. Transcriptome profiles were deduced from intestinal (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and neuroendocrine tissues (hypothalamus). Serum analyses of feed-efficient animals showed an increased content of the incretin GIP, calcium, magnesium, -hydroxybutyric acid, and fat compared with low-FE pigs. Complementary expression profiles in intestinal tissues indicate a modulated permeability and host-microbe interaction in FE-divergent pigs. Transcriptomic analyses of the hypothalamus showed that differences between the FE groups in appetite and satiety regulation are less pronounced. However, hypothalamic abundance of transcripts like ADCY7, LHCGR, and SLC2A7 and molecular signatures in local and systemic tissue sites indicate that increased allocation and circulation of energy equivalents, minerals, and hormones are promoted in feed-efficient animals.

SBSEC members are associated with multiple diseases in humans and animals including ruminal acidosis, infective endocarditis (IE) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, this review aims to re-evaluate adhesion and colonization abilities of SBSEC members of animal, human and food origin paired with genomic and functional host-microbe interaction data on their road from colonization to infection. SBSEC seem to be a marginal population during GIT symbiosis that can proliferate as opportunistic pathogens. Risk factors for human colonization are considered living in rural areas and animal-feces contact. Niche adaptation plays a pivotal role where <i>Streptococcus gallolyticus</i> subsp<i>. gallolyticus</i> (<i>SGG</i>) retained the ability to proliferate in various environments. Other SBSEC members have undergone genome reduction and niche-specific gene gain to yield important commensal, pathobiont and technological species. Selective colonization of CRC tissue is suggested for <i>SGG</i>, possibly related to increased adhesion to cancerous cell types featuring enhanced collagen IV accessibility. <i>SGG</i> can colonize, proliferate and may shape the tumor microenvironment to their benefit by tumor promotion upon initial neoplasia development. Bacteria cell surface structures including lipotheichoic acids, capsular polysaccharides and pilus loci (<i>pil1, pil2</i>, and <i>pil3)</i> govern adhesion.

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Constitutively Bound EGFR-Mediated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TLR9 Is Required for Its Ability To Signal.,"Mammalian TLRs recognize microbial infection or cell death-associated danger signals and trigger the appropriate cellular response. These responses determine the strength and the outcome of the host-microbe interaction. TLRs are transmembrane proteins located on the plasma or the endosomal membrane. Their ectodomains recognize specific microbial or endogenous ligands, and the cytoplasmic domains interact with specific proteins to activate intracellular signaling pathways. TLR9, an endosomal TLR, is activated by endocytosed DNA. Activated TLR9 recruits the cytoplasmic adapter MyD88 and other signaling proteins to induce the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and IFN. Uncontrolled activation of TLR9 leads to the undesired overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and consequent pathogenesis. Therefore, appropriate activation and the regulation of TLR9 signaling are critical. Tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation of TLR9 is essential for its activation; however, the role of specific Tyr kinases is not clear. In this article, we report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane-bound protein Tyr kinase, is essential for TLR9 signaling. Genetic ablation of EGFR or pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity attenuates TLR9-mediated induction of genes in myeloid and nonmyeloid cell types. EGFR is constitutively bound to TLR9; upon ligand stimulation, it mediates TLR9 Tyr phosphorylation, which leads to the recruitment of MyD88, activation of the signaling kinases and transcription factors, and gene induction. In mice, TLR9-mediated liver injury and death are blocked by an EGFR inhibitor or deletion of the EGFR gene from myeloid cells, which are the major producers of inflammatory cytokines.",29531172

Yet, we know surprisingly little about microbial community dynamics and the stability of host-microbe associations under adverse environmental conditions. To gain insight into the stability of coral host-microbe associations and holobiont structure, we assessed changes in the community structure of <i>Symbiodinium</i> and bacteria associated with the coral <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i> under excess organic nutrient conditions. <i>Pocillopora</i>-associated microbial communities were monitored over 14days in two independent experiments. We assessed the effect of excess dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and excess dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Exposure to excess nutrients rapidly affected coral health, resulting in two distinct stress phenotypes: coral bleaching under excess DOC and severe tissue sloughing (>90% tissue loss resulting in host mortality) under excess DON. These phenotypes were accompanied by structural changes in the <i>Symbiodinium</i> community. In contrast, the associated bacterial community remained remarkably stable and was dominated by two <i>Endozoicomonas</i> phylotypes, comprising on average 90% of 16S rRNA gene sequences. This dominance of <i>Endozoicomonas</i> even under conditions of coral bleaching and mortality suggests the bacterial community of <i>P.verrucosa</i> may be rather inflexible and thereby unable to respond or acclimatize to rapid changes in the environment, contrary to what was previously observed in other corals.

Taxon richness was increased in simulated pools, suggesting that pools paint a more comprehensive picture of the taxa associated with a host population. Furthermore, microbiome composition varied less between pools than between individuals, indicating that differences even out in pools. Variation in microbiome composition was larger between populations than between simulated pools from a single population, adding to the notion that there are population-specific effects on the Drosophila microbiome.

Among these virulent effectors, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) interact with the  subunit of host transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) to activate the transcription of host disease susceptibility genes. Functional TFIIA is a ternary complex comprising ,  and  subunits. However, whether TALEs recruit TFIIA, TFIIA, or both remains unknown. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which TALEs mediate host susceptibility gene activation require full elucidation. Here, we show that TALEs interact with the + binary subcomplex but not the ++ ternary complex of rice TFIIA (holo-OsTFIIA). The transcription factor binding (TFB) regions of TALEs, which are highly conserved in Xanthomonas species, have a dominant role in these interactions. Furthermore, the interaction between TALEs and the + complex exhibits robust DNA binding activity invitro. These results collectively demonstrate that TALE-carrying pathogens hijack the host basal transcription factors TFIIA and TFIIA, but not TFIIA, to enhance host susceptibility during pathogen infection. The uncovered mechanism widens new insights on host-microbe interaction and provide an applicable strategy to breed high-resistance crop varieties.",29331375

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced ubiquitously by Gram-negative bacteria including the gut commensal <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>. These vesicles can interact with the host in various ways but until now their complement of small molecules has not been investigated in this context. Using an untargeted high-coverage metabolomic approach we have measured the small molecule content of these vesicles in contrasting <i>in vitro</i> conditions to establish what role these metabolites could perform when packed into these vesicles. <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> packs OMVs with a highly conserved core set of small molecules which are strikingly enriched with mouse-digestible metabolites and with metabolites previously shown to be associated with colonization of the murine GIT. By use of an expanded genome-scale metabolic model of <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> and a potential host (the mouse) we have established many possible metabolic pathways between the two organisms that were previously unknown, and have found several putative novel metabolic functions for mouse that are supported by gene annotations, but that do not currently appear in existing mouse metabolic networks. The lipidome of these OMVs bears no relation to the mouse lipidome, so the purpose of this particular composition of lipids remains unclear. We conclude from this analysis that through intimate symbiotic evolution OMVs produced by <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> are likely to have been adopted as a conduit for small molecules bound for the mammalian host <i>in vivo</i>.",29276507

To date, proteomic approaches have been applied successfully in a handful of CRS studies. In this study we use a multifaceted approach, including proteomics (iTRAQ labeling) and microbiome (bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing) analyses of middle meatus swabs, as well as immune cell analysis of the underlying tissue, to investigate the host-microbe interaction in individuals with CRS (<i>n</i> = 10) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 9). Of the total 606 proteins identified in this study, seven were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) more abundant and 104 were significantly lower in the CRS cohort compared with healthy controls. The majority of detected proteins (82% of proteins identified) were not significantly correlated with disease status. Elevated levels of blood and immune cell proteins in the CRS cohort, together with significantly higher numbers of B-cells and macrophages in the underlying tissue, confirmed the inflammatory status of CRS individuals. Protein PRRC2C and Ras-related protein (RAB14) (two of the seven elevated proteins) showed the biggest fold difference between the healthy and CRS groups. Validation of the elevated levels of these two proteins in CRS samples was provided by immunohistochemistry. Members of the bacterial community in the two study cohorts were not associated with PRRC2C, however members of the genus <i>Moraxella</i> did correlate with RAB14 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, rho = -0.95), which is a protein involved in the development of basement membrane. In addition, significant correlations between certain members of the CRS bacterial community and 33 lower abundant proteins in the CRS cohort were identified. Members of the genera <i>Streptococcus, Haemophilus</i> and <i>Veillonella</i> were strongly correlated with CRS and were significantly associated with a number of proteins with varying functions. The results from this study reveal a strong association between the host and microbes in the sinonasal cavity.

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Transcriptome Sequencing Reveals Novel Candidate Genes for <i>Cardinium hertigii</i>-Caused Cytoplasmic Incompatibility and Host-Cell Interaction.,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is an intriguing, widespread, symbiont-induced reproductive failure that decreases offspring production of arthropods through crossing incompatibility of infected males with uninfected females or with females infected with a distinct symbiont genotype. For years, the molecular mechanism of CI remained unknown. Recent genomic, proteomic, biochemical, and cell biological studies have contributed to understanding of CI in the alphaproteobacterium <i>Wolbachia</i> and implicate genes associated with the WO prophage. Besides a recently discovered additional lineage of alphaproteobacterial symbionts only moderately related to <i>Wolbachia</i>, <i>Cardinium</i> (<i>Bacteroidetes</i>) is the only other symbiont known to cause CI, and genomic evidence suggests that it has very little homology with <i>Wolbachia</i> and evolved this phenotype independently. Here, we present the first transcriptomic study of the CI <i>Cardinium</i> strain <i>c</i>Eper1, in its natural host, <i>Encarsia suzannae</i>, to detect important CI candidates and genes involved in the insect-<i>Cardinium</i> symbiosis. Highly expressed transcripts included genes involved in manipulating ubiquitination, apoptosis, and host DNA. Female-biased genes encoding ribosomal proteins suggest an increase in general translational activity of <i>Cardinium</i> in female wasps. The results confirm previous genomic analyses that indicated that <i>Wolbachia</i> and <i>Cardinium</i> utilize different genes to induce CI, and transcriptome patterns further highlight expression of some common pathways that these bacteria use to interact with the host and potentially cause this enigmatic and fundamental manipulation of host reproduction. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The majority of insects carry maternally inherited intracellular bacteria that are important in their hosts' biology, ecology, and evolution. Some of these bacterial symbionts cause a reproductive failure known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, the mating of symbiont-infected males and uninfected females produces few or no daughters. The CI symbiont then spreads and can have a significant impact on the insect host population. <i>Cardinium</i>, a bacterial endosymbiont of the parasitoid wasp <i>Encarsia</i> in the <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, is the only bacterial lineage known to cause CI outside the <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i>, where <i>Wolbachia</i> and another recently discovered CI symbiont reside. Here, we sought insight into the gene expression of a CI-inducing <i>Cardinium</i> strain in its natural host, <i>Encarsia suzannae</i>. Our study provides the first insights into the <i>Cardinium</i> transcriptome and provides support for the hypothesis that <i>Wolbachia</i> and <i>Cardinium</i> target similar host pathways with distinct and largely unrelated sets of genes.",29181449

In this work, we have investigated the mechanisms of <i>R. hominis</i>-host cross talk using both murine and <i>in vitro</i> models. The complete genome sequence of <i>R. hominis</i> A2-183 was determined.

Further investigations were performed <i>in vitro</i> and using the TLR5KO and DSS-colitis murine models. In the bacterium, <i>R. hominis</i>, host gut colonization upregulated genes involved in conjugation/mobilization, metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis.

Mono-association of mice with <i>R. hominis</i> bacteria results in specific bidirectional gene expression patterns. A set of genes thought to be important for host colonization are induced in <i>R. hominis</i>, while the host cells respond by strengthening gut barrier function and enhancing Treg population expansion, possibly <i>via</i> TLR5-flagellin signaling.

Since Wolbachia cannot yet be genetically manipulated, and due to the constraints imposed when working with an intracellular symbiont, little is known about mechanisms used by Wolbachia for host interaction. Here we employed a bioinformatics pipeline and identified 163 candidate effectors, potentially secreted by Wolbachia into the host cell. A total of 84 of these candidates were then subjected to a screen of growth defects induced in yeast upon heterologous expression which identified 14 top candidates likely secreted by Wolbachia. These predicted secreted effectors may function in concert as we find that their native expression is correlated and is highly upregulated at specific time points during Drosophila development. In addition, the evolutionary histories of some of these predicted effectors are also correlated, suggesting they may function together, or in the same pathway, during host infection. Similarly, most of these predicted effectors are limited to one or two Wolbachia strains-perhaps reflecting shared evolutionary history and strain specific functions in host manipulation.

This revealed a highly dynamic transcriptional landscape, where major transcriptional shifts are conserved among chlamydial symbionts and pathogens. Our data served to propose a time-resolved model for type III protein secretion during the developmental cycle, and we provide evidence for a biphasic metabolism of <i>P.amoebophila</i> during infection, which involves energy parasitism and amino acids as the carbon source during initial stages and a postreplicative switch to endogenous glucose-based ATP production. This fits well with major transcriptional changes in the amoeba host, where upregulation of complex sugar breakdown precedes the <i>P.amoebophila</i> metabolic switch. The biphasic chlamydial metabolism represents a unique adaptation to exploit eukaryotic host cells, which likely contributed to the evolutionary success of this group of microbes. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Chlamydiae are known as major bacterial pathogens of humans, causing the ancient disease trachoma, but they are also frequently found in the environment where they infect ubiquitous protists such as amoebae.

Using the environmental chlamydia <i>Protochlamydia amoebophila</i> within its natural host, <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i>, we investigated gene expression dynamics <i>in vivo</i> and throughout the complete chlamydial developmental cycle for the first time. This allowed us to infer how a major virulence mechanism, the type III secretion system, is regulated and employed, and we show that the physiology of chlamydiae undergoes a complete shift regarding carbon metabolism and energy generation.

To gain a further structural understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the anchoring and assembly of sortase-dependent pili in less harmful bacteria, L. rhamnosus GG SpaE for crystallization was produced by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Although several attempts to crystallize the SpaE protein were unsuccessful, trigonal crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 3.1 were eventually produced using PEG 3350 as a precipitant and high protein concentrations. Further optimization with a combination of additives led to the generation of SpaE crystals in an orthorhombic form that diffracted to a higher resolution of 1.5.

To address this problem, we analyzed whether the bacterial community associated with the cosmopolitan and model sea anemone <i>Exaiptasia pallida</i> shows specific patterns across worldwide populations ranging from the Caribbean Sea, and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. By comparing sequences of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, we revealed that anemones host a complex and diverse microbial community. When examined at the phylum level, bacterial diversity and abundance associated with <i>E. pallida</i> are broadly conserved across geographic space with samples, containing largely <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroides.</i> However, the species-level makeup within these phyla differs drastically across space suggesting a high-level core microbiome with local adaptation of the constituents. Indeed, no bacterial OTU was ubiquitously found in all anemones samples. We also revealed changes in the microbial community structure after rearing anemone specimens in captivity within a period of four months. Furthermore, the variation in bacterial community assemblages across geographical locations did not correlate with the composition of microalgal <i>Symbiodinium</i> symbionts. Our findings contrast with the postulation that cnidarian hosts might actively select and maintain species-specific microbial communities that could have resulted from an intimate co-evolution process. The fact that <i>E. pallida</i> is likely an introduced species in most sampled localities suggests that this microbial turnover is a relatively rapid process. Our findings suggest that environmental settings, not host specificity, seem to dictate bacterial community structure associated with this sea anemone. More than maintaining a specific composition of bacterial species some cnidarians associate with a wide range of bacterial species as long as they provide the same physiological benefits towards the maintenance of a healthy host. The examination of the previously uncharacterized bacterial community associated with the cnidarian sea anemone model <i>E. pallida</i> is the first global-scale study of its kind.",28533949

Here, we present a complete genome assembly of the skin commensal yeast Malassezia sympodialis and demonstrate how proteogenomics can substantially improve gene annotation. Through long-read DNA sequencing, we obtained a gap-free genome assembly for M. sympodialis (ATCC 42132), comprising eight nuclear and one mitochondrial chromosome.

Infection with pneumolysin-deficient S. pneumoniae in the hindbrain ventricle showed attenuated growth and migration through the brain as compared to the wild-type strain. Time-lapse and confocal imaging revealed that the initial innate immune response to S. pneumoniae in the subarachnoid space mainly consisted of neutrophils and that pneumolysin-mediated cytolytic activity caused a marked reduction of phagocytes.

The virulence of 28 E. faecalis isolates representing 24 multilocus sequence types (MLSTs), including human commensal and clinical isolates as well as isolates from animals and of insect origin, was investigated using C. elegans strain glp-4 (bn2ts); sek-1 (km4). This revealed that 6 E. faecalis isolates behaved in a commensal manner with no nematocidal effect, while the remaining strains showed a time to 50% lethality ranging from 47 to 120 h. Principal component analysis showed that the difference in nematocidal activity explained 94% of the variance in the data. Assessment of known virulence traits revealed that gelatinase and cytolysin production accounted for 40.8% and 36.5% of the observed pathogenicity, respectively. However, coproduction of gelatinase and cytolysin did not increase virulence additively, accounting for 50.6% of the pathogenicity and therefore indicating a significant (26.7%) saturation effect. We employed a comparative genomic analysis approach using the 28 isolates comprising a collection of 82,356 annotated coding sequences (CDS) to identify 2,325 patterns of presence or absence among the investigated strains. Univariate statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) established that individual patterns positively correlated (n = 61) with virulence. The patterns were investigated to identify potential new virulence traits, among which we found five patterns consisting of the phage03-like gene clusters. Strains harboring phage03 showed, on average, 17% higher killing of C. elegans (P = 4.4e(-6)). The phage03 gene cluster was also present in gelatinase-and-cytolysin-negative strain E. faecalis JH2-2. Deletion of this phage element from the JH2-2 clinical strain rendered the mutant apathogenic in C. elegans, and a similar mutant of the nosocomial V583 isolate showed significantly attenuated virulence. Bioinformatics investigation indicated that, unlike other E. faecalis virulence traits, phage03-like elements were found at a higher frequency among nosocomial isolates. In conclusion, our report provides a valuable virulence map that explains enhancement in E. faecalis virulence and contributes to a deeper comprehension of the genetic mechanism leading to the transition from commensalism to a pathogenic lifestyle.",25776747

We analyzed the downstream processes of these cascades, i.e. the differential expression of effector and regulatory molecules due to a microbial challenge with a pathogenic strain of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in comparison to a non-pathogenic Bt strain. The protein abundance profile of the nematode was studied by quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ labeling and 2D-LC-MS analysis. We developed (i) a novel method for the preparation of defined C. elegans samples; (ii) a pooling strategy for fractions in 2D-LC separation schemes; and (iii) an isobaric labeling scheme reducing the number of necessary LC-MS experiments. More than 3,600 proteins were quantified, 288 of which showed altered abundances, implicating protein classes such as lectins, lysozymes, and transthyretin-like proteins to be involved in the nematode innate immune defense. A number of gene products previously only identified by transcriptomic profiling could be verified at the protein level. Moreover, several other protein classes such as proteases, proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis, structural proteins, and proteins involved in chromatin organization were detected. The results provide an overview of the physiological response towards a pathogen at protein level in the important model organism C. elegans, giving insights into highly complex host-pathogen interactions. This study identified system-wide effects of Bt intoxication on C. elegans at protein level, expanding the catalogue of immune effectors potentially acting towards the pathogen, and provide verification for numerous gene products implicated in previous transcriptomic studies.

"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Differential modulation by Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii of host peripheral lipid metabolism and histone acetylation in mouse gut organoids.,"The gut microbiota is essential for numerous aspects of human health. However, the underlying mechanisms of many host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on host epithelium using a novel ex vivo model based on mouse ileal organoids. We have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and products generated by two abundant microbiota constituents, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We observed that A.muciniphila metabolites affect various transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. Contrastingly, F.prausnitzii products exerted only weak effects on host transcription. Additionally, A.muciniphila and its metabolite propionate modulated expression of Fiaf, Gpr43, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Ppar), important regulators of transcription factor regulation, cell cycle control, lipolysis, and satiety. This work illustrates that specific bacteria and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoids. We demonstrate that intestinal organoids provide a novel and powerful ex vivo model for host-microbiome interaction studies. We investigated the influence of the gut microbiota and microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on gut functioning. Many commensal bacteria in the gut produce SCFAs, particularly butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders. Organoids-small crypt-villus structures grown from ileal intestinal stem cells-were exposed to SCFAs and two specific gut bacteria. Akkermansia muciniphila, found in the intestinal mucus, was recently shown to have a favorable effect on the disrupted metabolism associated with obesity. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a commensal gut bacterium, the absence of which may be associated with Crohn's disease. We showed that in our model, A.muciniphila induces stronger effects on the host than F.prausnitzii. We observed that A.muciniphila and propionate affect the expression of genes involved in host lipid metabolism and epigenetic activation or silencing of gene expression. We demonstrated that organoids provide a powerful tool for host-microbe interaction studies.",25118238
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",Small RNA functions in carbon metabolism and virulence of enteric pathogens.,"Enteric pathogens often cycle between virulent and saprophytic lifestyles. To endure these frequent changes in nutrient availability and composition bacteria possess an arsenal of regulatory and metabolic genes allowing rapid adaptation and high flexibility. While numerous proteins have been characterized with regard to metabolic control in pathogenic bacteria, small non-coding RNAs have emerged as additional regulators of metabolism. Recent advances in sequencing technology have vastly increased the number of candidate regulatory RNAs and several of them have been found to act at the interface of bacterial metabolism and virulence factor expression. Importantly, studying these riboregulators has not only provided insight into their metabolic control functions but also revealed new mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene control. This review will focus on the recent advances in this area of host-microbe interaction and discuss how regulatory small RNAs may help coordinate metabolism and virulence of enteric pathogens.",25077072
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",An ortholog of the Leptospira interrogans lipoprotein LipL32 aids in the colonization of Pseudoalteromonas tunicata to host surfaces.,"The bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata is a common surface colonizer of marine eukaryotes, including the macroalga Ulva australis.Genomic analysis of P. tunicata identified genes potentially involved in surface colonization, including genes with homology to bacterial virulence factors that mediate attachment. Of particular interest is the presence of a gene, designated ptlL32, encoding an ortholog to the Leptospira lipoprotein LipL32, which has been shown to facilitate the interaction of Leptospira sp. with host extracellular matrix (ECM) structures and is thought to be an important virulence trait for pathogenic Leptospira. To investigate the role of PtlL32 in the colonization by P. tunicata we constructed and characterized a ptlL32 mutant strain. Whilst P. tunicata ptlL32 bound to an abiotic surface with the same capacity as the wild type strain, it had a marked effect on the ability of P. tunicata to bind to ECM, suggesting a specific role in attachment to biological surfaces. Loss of PtlL32 also significantly reduced the capacity for P. tunciata to colonize the host algal surface demonstrating a clear role for this protein as a host-colonization factor. PtlL32 appears to have a patchy distribution across specific groups of environmental bacteria and phylogenetic analysis of PtlL32 orthologous proteins from non-Leptospira species suggests it may have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer between distantly related lineages. This study provides the first evidence for an attachment function for a LipL32-like protein outside the Leptospira and thereby contributes to the understanding of host colonization in ecologically distinct bacterial species.",25071736

We hypothesize that innate host factors mediate the observed negative association between IPD and the serotype 11A (ST11A) capsule O-acetyltransferase gene, wcjE. We evaluated the ability of ficolin-2, an initiator of the lectin complement pathway that was previously shown to bind ST11A pneumococci, to recognize and mediate complement-dependent opsonophagocytosis of different pneumococcal serotypes. We supplemented findings with an epidemiological meta-analysis comparing invasiveness of the 30 most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes. Ficolin-2 bound ST11A capsule polysaccharide and other wcjE-containing pneumococcal serotypes, except ST9V and ST20B. Ficolin-2 did not bind wcjE-null serotypes, including the wcjE-null variant of ST11A, ST11E. We observed C1q-independent complement deposition and phagocytic killing of pneumococci expressing ST11A but not those expressing ST11E. Inhibition of ficolin-2 binding abrogated ST11A-associated complement deposition and phagocytosis. In children, invasiveness of ST11A was the lowest among serotypes tested in our meta-analysis, while ST9V was among the highest. Ficolin-2 mediates serum protection by recognizing specific O-acetylated epitopes of pneumococcal capsule polysaccharides, exemplifying a novel host-microbe interaction that innately offers serotype-specific immunity to IPD.",24683196
"""host-microbe interaction"" AND ""gene""",PI3K/Akt pathway restricts epithelial adhesion of Dr + Escherichia coli by down-regulating the expression of decay accelerating factor.,"The urogenital microbial infection in pregnancy is an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains which express Dr fimbriae (Dr+) are associated with unique gestational virulence and they utilize cell surface decay accelerating factor (DAF or CD55) as one of the cellular receptor before invading the epithelial cells. Previous studies in our laboratory established that nitric oxide reduces the rate of E. coli invasion by delocalizing the DAF protein from cell surface lipid rafts and down-regulating its expression. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) cell signal pathway plays an important role in host-microbe interaction because many bacteria including E. coli activate this pathway in order to establish infection. In the present study, we showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway negatively regulated the expression of DAF on the epithelial cell surface and thus inhibited the adhesion of Dr(+) E. coli to epithelial cells. Initially, using two human cell lines Ishikawa and HeLa which differ in constitutive activity of PI3K/Akt, we showed that DAF levels were associated with the PI3K/Akt pathway. We then showed that the DAF gene expression was up-regulated and the Dr(+) E. coli adhesion increased after the suppression of PI3K/Akt pathway in Ishikawa cells using inhibitor LY294002, and a plasmid which allowed the expression of PI3K/Akt regulatory protein PTEN. The down-regulation of PTEN protein using PTEN-specific siRNA activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, down-regulated the DAF, and decreased the adhesion of Dr(+) E. coli. We conclude that the PI3K/Akt pathway regulated the DAF expression in a nitric oxide independent manner.",24599886

As such, the discovery that differential microbial composition is associated with alterations in behaviour and cognition has significantly contributed to establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as an extension of the well-accepted gut-brain axis concept. Many efforts have been focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. There is also a growing appreciation of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping brain and behaviour. However, the role of epigenetics in informing host-microbe interactions has received little attention to date. This is despite the fact that there are many plausible routes of interaction between epigenetic mechanisms and the host-microbiota dialogue. From this new perspective we put forward novel, yet testable, hypotheses. Firstly, we suggest that gut-microbial products can affect chromatin plasticity within their host's brain that in turn leads to changes in neuronal transcription and eventually alters host behaviour. Secondly, we argue that the microbiota is an important mediator of gene-environment interactions. Finally, we reason that the microbiota itself may be viewed as an epigenetic entity. In conclusion, the fields of (neuro)epigenetics and microbiology are converging at many levels and more interdisciplinary studies are necessary to unravel the full range of this interaction.",24286462

Vibrio campbellii, one of the major pathogens of aquatic organisms, regulates virulence gene expression by a three channel quorum sensing system. Here we show that although they use a common signal transduction cascade, the signal molecules have a different impact on the virulence of the bacterium towards different hosts, i.e. the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana and the commercially important giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. These results suggest that the use of multiple types of signal molecules to regulate virulence gene expression is one of the features that allow bacteria to infect different hosts.

This study focuses on the host-microbe interaction, specifically the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) against the pathogenic organism Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). NO and ROS play crucial roles in innate immunity and in the first-line defense against microbial invasion. Sinonasal tissue samples were harvested from CRS and control patients during surgery. CRS patients were classified S. aureus biofilm-positive (B+) or biofilm-negative (B-) using fluorescence in situ hybridization and clinically as polyp-positive (P+) or polyp-negative (P-). Samples were assessed using an NO polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array containing 84 genes involved in NO and ROS regulation, and gene expression of all subgroups were compared to each other. Twenty-three samples were analyzed with 31 genes significantly changed, the greatest seen in the B+P+ CRS patients. Four genes consistently displayed differential expression between the groups including the cytoprotective oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) and peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (NCF2), and the prion protein (PRNP) genes. Alteration in gene expression points to impaired innate immune responses differing among CRS subgroups based on S. aureus biofilm and polyp status. The consistent alteration of 4 genes among distinct groups demonstrates that S. aureus biofilms and polyps are associated with specific changes in gene expression.

A related bacterium, psyllid-vectored 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus,' is an obligate phytopathogen with a reduced genome that was previously analyzed for genes orthologous to genes on the S. meliloti circular chromosome. In general, proteins encoded by pSymA genes are more similar in sequence alignment to those encoded by S. meliloti chromosomal orthologs than to orthologous proteins encoded by genes carried on the 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' genome. Only two 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' proteins were identified as having orthologous proteins encoded on pSymA but not also encoded on the chromosome of S. meliloti. These two orthologous gene pairs encode a Na(+)/K+ antiporter (shared with intracellular pathogens of the family Bartonellacea) and a Co++, Zn++ and Cd++ cation efflux protein that is shared with the phytopathogen Agrobacterium. Another shared protein, a redox-regulated K+ efflux pump may regulate cytoplasmic pH and homeostasis. The pSymA and 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' orthologs of the latter protein are more highly similar in amino acid alignment compared with the alignment of the pSymA-encoded protein with its S. meliloti chromosomal homolog. About 182 pSymA encoded proteins have sequence similarity ( E-10) with 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' proteins, often present as multiple orthologs of single 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' proteins. These proteins are involved with amino acid uptake, cell surface structure, chaperonins, electron transport, export of bioactive molecules, cellular homeostasis, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction and synthesis of amino acids and metabolic cofactors. The presence of multiple orthologs defies mutational analysis and is consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins may be of particular importance in host/microbe interaction and their duplication likely facilitates their ongoing evolution.",22761700

We hypothesize that the microbiology of the oral cavity may differ in patients with IBD. Our laboratory has developed a 16S rRNA-based technique known as the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) to study the oral microbiome of children and young adults with IBD. Tongue and buccal mucosal brushings from healthy controls, CD, and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were analyzed using HOMIM. Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to compare population and phylum-level changes among our study groups.

Tongue samples from patients with UC did not show a significant change in overall microbial diversity as compared with healthy controls (P = 0.418). As detected by HOMIM, we found a significant decrease in overall diversity in the oral microbiome of pediatric CD.

Accordingly, we demonstrate for the first time that an obligate anaerobe, the successful opportunistic pathogen of the oral cavity, Porphyromonas gingivalis, can be genetically engineered for expression of the non-toxic green FbFP. The resulting transformants are functional for studying dynamic bacterial processes in living host cells. The visualization of the transformed P. gingivalis (PgFbFP) revealed strong fluorescence that reached a maximum emission at 495 nm as determined by fluorescence microscopy and spectrofluorometry. Human primary gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were infected with PgFbFP and the bacterial invasion of host cells was analyzed by a quantitative fluorescence microscopy and antibiotic protection assays. The results showed similar levels of intracellular bacteria for both wild type and PgFbFP strains. In conjunction with organelle specific fluorescent dyes, utilization of the transformed strain provided direct and accurate determination of the live/metabolically active P. gingivalis' trafficking in the GECs over time. Furthermore, the GECs were co-infected with PgFbFP and the ATP-dependent Clp serine protease-deficient mutant (ClpP-) to study the differential fates of the two strains within the same host cells. Quantitative co-localization analyses displayed the intracellular PgFbFP significantly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum network, whereas the majority of ClpP- organisms trafficked into the lysosomes.

We investigated the effects of the wild type and mutated alleles of the gene, which encodes the protein called pyrin, one of the regulators of innate immunity, on the composition of gut commensal bacteria. Mutations in MEFV lead to the autoinflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF, MIM249100), which is characterized by recurrent self-resolving attacks of fever and polyserositis, with no clinical signs of disease in remission.

Cells were differentiated, infected with S enteritidis, and the number of live intracellular S enteritidis organisms was determined using the colony-forming unit method. To visualize intracellular S enteritidis, the bacteria were transformed with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and studied by confocal microscopy. Cells expressing wild-type HLA-B27 were more permissive of intracellular replication of S enteritidis compared with mock-transfected or A2-transfected controls. Cells expressing B27 with an altered B pocket composition having either 6 amino acid substitutions (B27.A2B; substitutions H9F, T24A, E45M, I66K, C67V, and K70H) or a single substitution (B27.E45M) were no longer permissive of S enteritidis replication. In contrast, cells expressing B27 with the single substitution of F for H at position 9 (B27.H9F) retained their permissiveness. Studies using GFP-transformed S enteritidis confirmed that the increase in the amount of intracellular bacteria in B27-expressing cells was due to replication of the bacteria.

However, studies on their mechanisms of action have been largely neglected, particularly their effects on liver, the primary target organ for host-microbe interaction. Here we show that treatment with either complete (CFA) or incomplete (IFA) Freund adjuvant induced a 5-10-fold increase in toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 mRNA but not TLR4 mRNA in livers of mice. Since CFA is essentially made of killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli (Mtb) dissolved in IFA, it is the solvent in CFA that induced an increase in TLR2 expression. As TLR2 is the receptor activated by killed Mtb, this solvent-mediated increase in TLR2 expression will result in enhanced recognition of killed Mtb by hepatocytes during CFA administration.

Cultures of primary mouse hepatocytes were incubated with LPS to assess its effects on the global gene expression, hepatic transcription factors, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. DNA microarray analysis indicated that LPS modulates the selective expression of more than 80 genes and expressed sequence tags. We have shown previously that hepatocytes express CD14, which is required both for uptake and responsiveness to LPS. In other cells, responsiveness to microbial products requires expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and their associated accessory molecules. Hepatocytes expressed TLR1 through TLR9 as well as MyD88 and MD-2 transcripts, as shown by reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, indicating that hepatocytes express all known microbe recognition molecules. The MAP kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was phosphorylated in response to LPS in mouse hepatocytes, and the levels of phosphorylation were lower in hepatocytes from TLR4-null mice. NF-kappa B activation was reduced in TLR4-mutant or -null hepatocytes compared to control hepatocytes, and this defect was partially restored by adenoviral transduction of mouse TLR4.

Based on recent findings that the mammalian homologue of Drosophila Toll participates in LPS signaling, we examined the regulation of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) gene expression by cytokines in vitro and its distribution in vivo with a focus on the liver as a site of host-microbe interaction. Our results show that IL-1beta and/or TNFalpha participate in the upregulation of TLR2 mRNA levels in hepatocytes. Rats treated concurrently with LPS and antagonists of the IL-1 or TNFalpha receptor demonstrated significantly reduced LPS-induced hepatic expression of TLR2 compared to animals treated with LPS alone. The increase in hepatic TLR2 mRNA expression was associated with enhanced transcription as determined by nuclear run-on analysis.

Therefore, we have developed a suite of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) vectors for inducible repression of specificV. fischerigenes associated with symbiotic competence. The suite utilizes both Tn7-integrating and shuttle vector plasmids that allow for inducible expression of CRISPRi dCas9 protein along with single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) modules. We validated this CRISPRi tool suite by targeting both exogenous (an introduced mRFP reporter) and endogenous genes (luxC in the bioluminescence producing lux operon, and flrA, the major regulatory gene controlling flagella production). The suite includes shuttle vectors expressing both single and multiple sgRNAs complementary to the non-template strand of multiple targeted genetic loci, which were effective in inducible gene repression, with significant reductions in targeted gene expression levels. V. fischeri cells harboring a version of this system targeting the luxC gene and suppressing the production of luminescence were used to experimentally validate the hypothesis that continuous luminescence must be produced by the symbiont in order to maintain the symbiosis at time points longer than the known 24-h limit.

"""Euprymna scolopes"" AND ""Vibrio fischeri"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Evidence of Genomic Diversification in a Natural Symbiotic Population Within Its Host.,"Planktonic cells of the luminous marine bacterium <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> establish themselves in the light-emitting organ of each generation of newly hatched <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> bobtail squid. A symbiont population is maintained within the 6 separated crypts of the organ for the 9-month life of the host. In the wild, the initial colonization step is typically accomplished by a handful of planktonic <i>V. fischeri</i> cells, leading to a species-specific, but often multi-strain, symbiont population. Within a few hours, the inoculating cells proliferate within the organ's individual crypts, after which there is evidently no supernumerary colonization. Nevertheless, every day at dawn, the majority of the symbionts is expelled, and the regrowth of the remaining 5% of cells provides a daily opportunity for the population to evolve and diverge, thereby increasing its genomic diversity. To begin to understand the extent of this diversification, we characterized the light-organ population of an adult animal. First, we used 16S sequencing to determine that species in the <i>V. fischeri</i> clade were essentially the only ones detectable within a field-caught <i>E. scolopes</i>. Efforts to colonize the host with a minor species that appeared to be identified, <i>V. litoralis</i>, revealed that, although some cells could be imaged within the organ, they were <0.1% of the typical <i>V. fischeri</i> population, and did not persist. Next, we determined the genome sequences of seventy-two isolates from one side of the organ. While all these isolates were associated with one of three clusters of <i>V. fischeri</i> strains, there was considerable genomic diversity within this natural symbiotic population. Comparative analyses revealed a significant difference in both the number and the presence/absence of genes within each cluster; in contrast, there was little accumulation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These data suggest that, in nature, the light organ is colonized by a small number of <i>V. fischeri</i> strains that can undergo significant genetic diversification, including by horizontal-gene transfer, over the course of 1500 generations of growth in the organ. When the resulting population of symbionts is expelled into seawater, its genomic mix provides the genetic basis for selection during the subsequent environmental dispersal, and transmission to the next host.",35300477
"""Euprymna scolopes"" AND ""Vibrio fischeri"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",sRNA chaperone Hfq controls bioluminescence and other phenotypes through Qrr1-dependent and -independent mechanisms in Vibrio fischeri.,"Colonization of the squid Euprymna scolopes by the bacterium Vibrio fischeri depends on bacterial biofilm formation, motility, and bioluminescence. Previous work has demonstrated an inhibitory role for the small RNA (sRNA) Qrr1 in quorum-induced bioluminescence of V. fischeri, but the contribution of the corresponding sRNA chaperone, Hfq, was not examined. We thus hypothesized that V. fischeri Hfq similarly functions to inhibit bacterial bioluminescence as well as regulate other key steps of symbiosis, including bacterial biofilm formation and motility. Surprisingly, deletion of hfq increased luminescence of V. fischeri beyond what was observed for the loss of qrr1 sRNA. Epistasis experiments revealed that, while Hfq contributes to the Qrr1-dependent regulation of light production, it also functions independently of Qrr1 and its downstream target, LitR. This Hfq-dependent, Qrr1-independent regulation of bioluminescence is also independent of the major repressor of light production in V. fischeri, ArcA. We further determined that Hfq is required for full motility of V. fischeri in a mechanism that partially depends on the Qrr1/LitR regulators. Finally, Hfq also appears to function in the control of biofilm formation: loss of Hfq delayed the timing and diminished the extent of wrinkled colony development, but did not eliminate the production of SYP-polysaccharide-dependent cohesive colonies. Furthermore, loss of Hfq enhanced production of cellulose and resulted in increased Congo red binding. Together, these findings point to Hfq as an important regulator of multiple phenotypes relevant to symbiosis between V. fischeri and its squid host.",34756963

Instead, genetically engineered strains, such as those lacking the negative regulator BinK, have been developed to study this phenomenon. Historically, V. fischeri has been grown using LBS, a complex medium containing tryptone and yeast extract; supplementation with calcium is required to induce biofilm formation by a <i>binK</i> mutant. Here, through our discovery that yeast extract inhibits biofilm formation, we uncover signals and underlying mechanisms that control V. fischeri biofilm formation. In contrast to its inability to form a biofilm on unsupplemented LBS, a <i>binK</i> mutant formed cohesive, SYP-dependent colony biofilms on tTBS, modified LBS that lacks yeast extract. Moreover, wild-type strain ES114 became proficient to form cohesive, SYP-dependent biofilms when grown in tTBS supplemented with both calcium and the vitamin para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA); neither molecule alone was sufficient, indicating that this phenotype relies on coordinating two cues. pABA/calcium supplementation also inhibited bacterial motility. Consistent with these phenotypes, cells grown in tTBS with pABA/calcium were enriched in transcripts for biofilm-related genes and predicted diguanylate cyclases, which produce the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). They also exhibited elevated levels of c-di-GMP, which was required for the observed phenotypes, as phosphodiesterase overproduction abrogated biofilm formation and partially rescued motility. This work thus provides insight into conditions, signals, and processes that promote biofilm formation by V. fischeri. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria integrate environmental signals to regulate gene expression and protein production to adapt to their surroundings. One such behavioral adaptation is the formation of a biofilm, which can promote adherence and colonization and provide protection against antimicrobials. Identifying signals that trigger biofilm formation and the underlying mechanism(s) of action remain important and challenging areas of investigation. Here, we determined that yeast extract, commonly used for growth of bacteria in laboratory culture, inhibits biofilm formation by Vibrio fischeri, a model bacterium used for investigating host-relevant biofilm formation. Omitting yeast extract from the growth medium led to the identification of an unusual signal, the vitamin para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), that when added together with calcium could induce biofilm formation. pABA increased the concentrations of the second messenger, c-di-GMP, which was necessary but not sufficient to induce biofilm formation. This work thus advances our understanding of signals and signal integration controlling bacterial biofilm formation.",34607467

In one example, the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri enters, grows to a dense population within, and persists for months inside, the light-emitting organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes. Crucial to the symbiont's success after entry is the ability to trigger the constriction of a host tissue region (the ""bottleneck"") at the entrance to the colonization site. Bottleneck constriction begins at about the same time as bioluminescence, which is induced in V. fischeri through an autoinduction process called quorum sensing. Here, we asked the following questions: (i) Are the quorum signals that induce symbiont bioluminescence also involved in triggering the constriction? (ii) Does improper signaling of constriction affect the normal maintenance of the symbiont population? We manipulated the presence of three factors, the two V. fischeri quorum signal synthases, AinS and LuxI, the transcriptional regulator LuxR, and light emission itself, and found that the major factor triggering and maintaining bottleneck constriction is an as yet unknown effector(s) regulated by LuxIR. Treating the animal with chemical inhibitors of actin polymerization reopened the bottlenecks, recapitulating the host's response to quorum-sensing defective symbionts, as well as suggesting that actin polymerization is the primary mechanism underlying constriction. Finally, we found that these host responses to the presence of symbionts changed as a function of tissue maturation. Taken together, this work broadens our concept of how quorum sensing can regulate host development, thereby allowing bacteria to maintain long-term tissue associations. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Interbacterial signaling within a host-associated population can have profound effects on the behavior of the bacteria, for instance, in their production of virulence/colonization factors; in addition, such signaling can dictate the nature of the outcome for the host, in both pathogenic and beneficial associations. Using the monospecific squid-vibrio model of symbiosis, we examined how quorum-sensing regulation by the Vibrio fischeri population induces a biogeographic tissue phenotype that promotes the retention of this extracellular symbiont within the light organ of its host, Euprymna scolopes. Understanding the influence of bacterial symbionts on key sites of tissue architecture has implications for all horizontally transmitted symbioses, especially those that colonize an epithelial surface within the host.",34579565
"""Euprymna scolopes"" AND ""Vibrio fischeri"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",Quorum Sensing and Cyclic di-GMP Exert Control Over Motility of <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> KB2B1.,"Bacterial motility is critical for symbiotic colonization by <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> of its host, the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>, facilitating movement from surface biofilms to spaces deep inside the symbiotic organ. While colonization has been studied traditionally using strain ES114, others, including KB2B1, can outcompete ES114 for colonization for a variety of reasons, including superior biofilm formation. We report here that KB2B1 also exhibits an unusual pattern of migration through a soft agar medium: whereas ES114 migrates rapidly and steadily, KB2B1 migrates slowly and then ceases migration. To better understand this phenomenon, we isolated and sequenced five motile KB2B1 suppressor mutants. One harbored a mutation in the gene for the cAMP receptor protein (<i>crp</i>); because this strain also exhibited a growth defect, it was not characterized further. Two other suppressors contained mutations in the quorum sensing pathway that controls bacterial bioluminescence in response to cell density, and two had mutations in the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) gene <i>VF_1200</i>. Subsequent analysis indicated that (1) the quorum sensing mutations shifted KB2B1 to a perceived low cell density state and (2) the high cell density state inhibited migration <i>via</i> the downstream regulator LitR. Similar to the initial point mutations, deletion of the <i>VF_1200</i> DGC gene increased migration. Consistent with the possibility that production of the second messenger c-di-GMP inhibited the motility of KB2B1, reporter-based measurements of c-di-GMP revealed that KB2B1 produced higher levels of c-di-GMP than ES114, and overproduction of a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase promoted migration of KB2B1. Finally, we assessed the role of viscosity in controlling the quorum sensing pathway using polyvinylpyrrolidone and found that viscosity increased light production of KB2B1 but not ES114. Together, our data indicate that while the two strains share regulators in common, they differ in the specifics of the regulatory control over downstream phenotypes such as motility.",34262549

These bacteria are deposited from the accessory nidamental gland into the squid's egg cases, where the consortium prevents microbial fouling. The symbiont community is environmentally transmitted and conserved across host populations, yet little is known about how the organ develops and is colonized by bacteria. In order to understand accessory nidamental gland development in <i>E. scolopes</i>, we characterized the gland during maturation by using histology and confocal and transmission electron microscopy. We found that an epithelial field formed first about four weeks after hatching, followed by the proliferation of numerous pores during what we hypothesize to be the initiation of bacterial recruitment (early development). Microscopy revealed that these pores were connected to ciliated invaginations that occasionally contained bacteria. During mid development, these epithelial fields expanded, and separate colonized tubules were observed below the epithelial layer that contained the pores and invaginations. During late development, the superficial epithelial fields appeared to regress as animals approached sexual maturity and were never observed in fully mature adults (about 2-3 months post-hatching), suggesting that they help facilitate bacterial colonization of the accessory nidamental gland. An analysis of <i>16S rRNA</i> gene diversity in accessory nidamental glands from females of varying size showed that the bacterial community changed as the host approached sexual maturity, increasing in community evenness and shifting from a Verrucomicrobia-dominated to an Alphaproteobacteria-dominated consortium. Given the host's relationship with the well-characterized light organ symbiont <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>, our work suggests that the accessory nidamental gland of <i>E. scolopes</i> may have similar mechanisms to recruit bacteria from the environment. Understanding the developmental and colonization processes of the accessory nidamental gland will expand the use of <i>E. scolopes</i> as a model organism for studying bacterial consortia in marine symbioses.",34129444

Colonization of the host relies on bacterial biofilm-like aggregation in the squid mucus field. Symbiotic biofilm formation is controlled by a two-component signaling (TCS) system consisting of regulators RscS-SypF-SypG, which together direct transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide Syp. TCS systems are broadly important for bacteria to sense environmental cues and then direct changes in behavior. Previously, we identified the hybrid histidine kinase BinK as a strong negative regulator of V. fischeri biofilm regulation, and here we further explore the function of BinK. To inhibit biofilm formation, BinK requires the predicted phosphorylation sites in both the histidine kinase (H362) and receiver (D794) domains. Furthermore, we show that RscS is not essential for host colonization when <i>binK</i> is deleted from strain ES114, and imaging of aggregate size revealed no benefit to the presence of RscS in a background lacking BinK. Strains lacking RscS still suffered in competition. Finally, we show that BinK functions to inhibit biofilm gene expression in the light organ crypts, providing evidence for biofilm gene regulation at later stages of host colonization. Overall, this study provides direct evidence for opposing activities of RscS and BinK and yields novel insights into biofilm regulation during the maturation of a beneficial symbiosis. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria are often in a biofilm state, and transitions between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles are important for pathogenic, beneficial, and environmental microbes. The critical nature of biofilm formation during Vibrio fischeri colonization of the Hawaiian bobtail squid light organ provides an opportunity to study development of this process <i>in vivo</i> using a combination of genetic and imaging approaches. The current work refines the signaling circuitry of the biofilm pathway in V. fischeri, provides evidence that biofilm regulatory changes occur in the host, and identifies BinK as one of the regulators of that process.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that bind to target mRNAs, rapidly shaping gene expression by posttranscriptional control of mRNA translation and decay. Here, we show that, in the experimentally tractable binary squid-vibrio symbiosis, colonization of the light organ induces extensive changes in the miRNA transcriptome. Examination of the squid genome revealed the presence of evolutionarily conserved genes encoding elements essential for the production and processing of miRNAs. At 24 h postcolonization, 215 host miRNAs were detected in the light organ, 26 of which were differentially expressed in response to the symbionts. A functional enrichment analysis of genes potentially targeted by downregulation of certain miRNAs at the initiation of symbiosis revealed two major gene ontology (GO) term categories, neurodevelopment and tissue remodeling. This symbiont-induced downregulation is predicted to promote these activities in host tissues and is consistent with the well-described tissue remodeling that occurs at the onset of the association. Conversely, predicted targets of upregulated miRNAs, including the production of mucus, are consistent with attenuation of immune responses by symbiosis. Taken together, our data provide evidence that, at the onset of symbiosis, host miRNAs in the light organ drive alterations in gene expression that (i) orchestrate the symbiont-induced development of host tissues, and (ii) facilitate the partnership by dampening the immune response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Animals often acquire their microbiome from the environment at each generation, making the initial interaction of the partners a critical event in the establishment and development of a stable, healthy symbiosis. However, the molecular nature of these earliest interactions is generally difficult to study and poorly understood. We report that, during the initial 24 h of the squid-vibrio association, a differential expression of host miRNAs is triggered by the presence of the microbial partner. Predicted mRNA targets of these miRNAs were associated with regulatory networks that drive tissue remodeling and immune suppression, two major symbiosis-induced developmental outcomes in this and many other associations. These results implicate regulation by miRNAs as key to orchestrating the critical transcriptional responses that occur very early during the establishment of a symbiosis. Animals with more complex microbiota may have similar miRNA-driven responses as their association is initiated, supporting an evolutionary conservation of symbiosis-induced developmental mechanisms.",33975964

To identify colonization factors in this system, our lab previously conducted a global transposon insertion sequencing (INSeq) screen and identified over 300 putative novel squid colonization factors in <i>V. fischeri</i> To pursue mechanistic studies on these candidate genes, we present an approach to quickly generate barcode-tagged gene deletions and perform high-throughput squid competition experiments with detection of the proportion of each strain in the mixture by barcode sequencing (BarSeq). Our deletion approach improves on previous techniques based on splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) and <i>tfoX</i>-based natural transformation by incorporating a randomized barcode that results in unique DNA sequences within each deletion scar. Amplicon sequencing of the pool of barcoded strains before and after colonization faithfully reports on known colonization factors and provides increased sensitivity over colony counting methods.

Further characterization of biofilm enhancement suggested that this phenotype was due to the overproduction of cellulose, and it was dependent on the <i>bcsA</i> cellulose synthase. Additionally, the <i>amiB</i> mutant was nonmotile, perhaps due to defects in its ability to septate during division. The amidase mutant was unable to compete with the wild type for the colonization of <i>V. fischeri</i>'s symbiotic host, the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> In single-strain inoculations, host squid inoculated with the mutant eventually became colonized but with a much lower efficiency than in squid inoculated with the wild type. This observation was consistent with the pleiotropic effects of the <i>amiB</i> mutation and led us to speculate that motile suppressors of the <i>amiB</i> mutant were responsible for the partially restored colonization. In culture, motile suppressor mutants carried point mutations in a single gene (<i>VF_1477</i>), resulting in a partial restoration of wild-type motility. In addition, these point mutations reversed the effect of the <i>amiB</i> mutation on cellulosic biofilm production. These data are consistent with <i>V. fischeri</i> AmiB possessing amidase activity; they also suggest that AmiB suppresses cellulosic biofilm formation but promotes successful host colonization.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Peptidoglycan (PG) is a critical microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that is sloughed by cells of <i>V. fischeri</i> during symbiotic colonization of squid.

The host's response to colonization by the ssrA strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the ssrA strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities.

One such rhythm is a diurnal shift in symbiont metabolism triggered by the periodic provision of a specific nutrient by the mature host: each night the symbionts catabolize chitin released from hemocytes (phagocytic immune cells) that traffic into the light-organ crypts, where the population of <i>V. fischeri</i> cells resides. Nocturnal migration of these macrophage-like cells, together with identification of an <i>E. scolopes</i> MIF (EsMIF) in the light-organ transcriptome, led us to ask whether EsMIF might be the gatekeeper controlling the periodic movement of the hemocytes.

EsMIF inhibited migration of isolated hemocytes, whereas exported bacterial products, including peptidoglycan derivatives and secreted chitin catabolites, induced migration.

Two types of <i>V. fischeri</i> strains have been distinguished based upon their behavior in cocolonization competition assays in juvenile <i>E. scolopes</i>, i.e., (i) niche-sharing or (ii) niche-dominant behavior. This study aimed to determine whether these behaviors are observed with other <i>V. fischeri</i> strains or whether they are specific to those isolated from <i>E. scolopes</i> light organs. Cocolonization competition assays between <i>V. fischeri</i> strains isolated from the congeneric squid <i>E. morsei</i> or from other marine animals revealed the same sharing or dominant behaviors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing of these strains showed that the dominant behavior is polyphyletic and not associated with the presence or absence of a single gene or genes. Comparative genomics of 44 squid light organ isolates from around the globe led to the identification of symbiosis-specific candidates in the genomes of these strains. Colonization assays using genetic derivatives with deletions of these candidates established the importance of two such genes in colonization. This study has allowed us to expand the concept of distinct colonization behaviors to strains isolated from a number of squid and fish hosts.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> There is an increasing recognition of the importance of strain differences in the ecology of a symbiotic bacterial species and, in particular, how these differences underlie crucial interactions with their host. Nevertheless, little is known about the genetic bases for these differences, how they manifest themselves in specific behaviors, and their distribution among symbionts of different host species. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> isolated from the tissues of squids and fishes and applied comparative genomics approaches to look for patterns between symbiont lineages and host colonization behavior. In addition, we identified the only two genes that were exclusively present in all <i>V. fischeri</i> strains isolated from the light organs of sepiolid squid species. Mutational studies of these genes indicated that they both played a role in colonization of the squid light organ, emphasizing the value of applying a comparative genomics approach in the study of symbioses.",32127462

Strains that are susceptible to the T6SS fail to establish symbiosis with a T6SS-positive strain within the same location of the squid light organ, which is a phenomenon termed strain incompatibility. This study investigates the regulation of the T6SS in <i>V. fischeri</i> strain FQ-A001. Here, we report that the expression of Hcp, a necessary structural component of the T6SS, depends on the alternative sigma factor <sup>54</sup> and the bacterial enhancer binding protein VasH. VasH is necessary for FQ-A001 to kill other strains, suggesting that VasH-dependent regulation is essential for the T6SS of <i>V. fischeri</i> to affect intercellular interactions. In addition, this study demonstrates VasH-dependent transcription of <i>hcp</i> within host-associated populations of FQ-A001, suggesting that the T6SS is expressed within the host environment. Together, these findings establish a model for transcriptional control of <i>hcp</i> in <i>V. fischeri</i> within the squid light organ, thereby increasing understanding of how the T6SS is regulated during symbiosis.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Animals harbor bacterial symbionts with specific traits that promote host fitness. Mechanisms that facilitate intercellular interactions among bacterial symbionts impact which bacterial lineages ultimately establish symbiosis with the host.

"""Euprymna scolopes"" AND ""Vibrio fischeri"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","Ambient pH Alters the Protein Content of Outer Membrane Vesicles, Driving Host Development in a Beneficial Symbiosis.","Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are continuously produced by Gram-negative bacteria and are increasingly recognized as ubiquitous mediators of bacterial physiology. In particular, OMVs are powerful effectors in interorganismal interactions, driven largely by their molecular contents. These impacts have been studied extensively in bacterial pathogenesis but have not been well documented within the context of mutualism. Here, we examined the proteomic composition of OMVs from the marine bacterium <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>, which forms a specific mutualism with the Hawaiian bobtail squid, <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> We found that <i>V. fischeri</i> upregulates transcription of its major outer membrane protein, OmpU, during growth at an acidic pH, which <i>V. fischeri</i> experiences when it transitions from its environmental reservoir to host tissues. We used comparative genomics and DNA pulldown analyses to search for regulators of <i>ompU</i> and found that differential expression of <i>ompU</i> is governed by the OmpR, H-NS, and ToxR proteins. This transcriptional control combines with nutritional conditions to govern OmpU levels in OMVs. Under a host-encountered acidic pH, <i>V. fischeri</i> OMVs become more potent stimulators of symbiotic host development in an OmpU-dependent manner. Finally, we found that symbiotic development could be stimulated by OMVs containing a homolog of OmpU from the pathogenic species <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, connecting the role of a well-described virulence factor with a mutualistic element. This work explores the symbiotic effects of OMV variation, identifies regulatory machinery shared between pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria, and provides evidence of the role that OMVs play in animal-bacterium mutualism.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Beneficial bacteria communicate with their hosts through a variety of means. These communications are often carried out by a combination of molecules that stimulate responses from the host and are necessary for development of the relationship between these organisms. Naturally produced bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain many of those molecules and can stimulate a wide range of responses from recipient organisms. Here, we describe how a marine bacterium, <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>, changes the makeup of its OMVs under conditions that it experiences as it goes from its free-living lifestyle to associating with its natural host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid.

We used the natural binary light-organ symbiosis between the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> and its luminous bacterial partner, <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>, to define the impact of colonization on transcriptomic networks in the host. A night-active predator, <i>E. scolopes</i> coordinates the bioluminescence of its symbiont with visual cues from the environment to camouflage against moon and starlight. Like mammals, this symbiosis has a complex developmental program and a strong day/night rhythm. We determined how symbiont colonization impacted gene expression in the light organ itself, as well as in two anatomically remote organs: the eye and gill. While the overall transcriptional signature of light organ and gill were more alike, the impact of symbiosis was most pronounced and similar in light organ and eye, both in juvenile and adult animals. Furthermore, the presence of a symbiosis drove daily rhythms of transcription within all three organs. Finally, a single mutation in <i>V. fischeri</i>-specifically, deletion of the <i>lux</i> operon, which abrogates symbiont luminescence-reduced the symbiosis-dependent transcriptome of the light organ by two-thirds. In addition, while the gills responded similarly to light-organ colonization by either the wild-type or mutant, luminescence was required for all of the colonization-associated transcriptional responses in the juvenile eye.

In the association between the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> and its luminous bacterial partner Vibrio fischeri, the symbionts interact with two epithelial fields; they interact (i) transiently with the superficial ciliated field that potentiates colonization and regresses within days of colonization and (ii) persistently with the cells that line the internal crypts, whose ultrastructure changes in response to the symbionts. Development of the association creates conditions that promote the symbiotic partner over the lifetime of the host. To determine whether light organ maturation requires continuous interactions with V. fischeri or only the signaling that occurs during its initiation, we compared 4-week-old squid that were uncolonized with those colonized either persistently by wild-type V. fischeri or transiently by a V. fischeri mutant that triggers early events in morphogenesis but does not persist. Microscopic analysis of the light organs showed that, while morphogenesis of the superficial ciliated field is greatly accelerated by V. fischeri colonization, its eventual outcome is largely independent of colonization state. In contrast, the symbiont-induced changes in crypt cell shape require persistent host-symbiont interaction, reflected in the similarity between uncolonized and transiently colonized animals. Transcriptomic analyses reflected the microscopy results; host gene expression at 4weeks was due primarily to the persistent interactions of host and symbiont cells. Further, the transcriptomic signature of specific pathways reflected the daily rhythm of symbiont release and regrowth and required the presence of the symbionts. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> A long-term relationship between symbiotic partners is often characterized by development and maturation of host structures that harbor the symbiont cells over the host's lifetime. To understand the mechanisms involved in symbiosis maintenance more fully, we studied the mature bobtail squid, whose light-emitting organ, under experimental conditions, can be transiently or persistently colonized by Vibrio fischeri or remain uncolonized. Superficial anatomical changes in the organ were largely independent of symbiosis. However, both the microanatomy of cells with which symbionts interact and the patterns of gene expression in the mature animal were due principally to the persistent interactions of host and symbiont cells rather than to a response to early colonization events. Further, the characteristic pronounced daily rhythm on the host transcriptome required persistent V. fischeri colonization of the organ. This experimental study provides a window into how persistent symbiotic colonization influences the form and function of host animal tissues.",30320217

A natural model used to study biofilm formation is the symbiosis between <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid, <i>Euprymna scolopes</i> Host-relevant biofilm formation is a tightly regulated process and is observed <i>in vitro</i> only with strains that have been genetically manipulated to overexpress or disrupt specific regulators, primarily two-component signaling (TCS) regulators. These regulators control biofilm formation by dictating the production of the symbiosis polysaccharide (Syp-PS), the major component of the biofilm matrix. Control occurs both at and below the level of transcription of the <i>syp</i> genes, which are responsible for Syp-PS production. Here, we probed the roles of the two known negative regulators of biofilm formation, BinK and SypE, by generating double mutants. We also mapped and evaluated a point mutation using natural transformation and linkage analysis. We examined traditional biofilm formation phenotypes and established a new assay for evaluating the start of biofilm formation in the form of microscopic aggregates in shaking liquid cultures, in the absence of the known biofilm-inducing signal calcium. We found that wrinkled colony formation is negatively controlled not only by BinK and SypE but also by SypF. SypF is both required for and inhibitory to biofilm formation. Together, these data reveal that these three regulators are sufficient to prevent wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> from forming biofilms under these conditions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacterial biofilms promote attachment to a variety of surfaces and protect the constituent bacteria from environmental stresses, including antimicrobials. Understanding the mechanisms by which biofilms form will promote our ability to resolve them when they occur in the context of an infection. In this study, we found that <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> tightly controls biofilm formation using three negative regulators; the presence of a single one of these regulators was sufficient to prevent full biofilm development, while disruption of all three permitted robust biofilm formation.

We sought to synthesize an optimized transcriptional reporter for assessing PhoB activity, aiming for maximal ""on"" expression when PhoB is active, minimal background in the ""off"" state, and no control elements for other regulators. We designed specific sequences for promoter elements with appropriately spaced PhoB-binding sites, and at 19 additional intervening nucleotide positions for which we did not predict sequence-specific effects, the bases were randomized. Eighty-three such constructs were screened in <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>, enabling us to identify bases at particular randomized positions that significantly correlated with high-level ""on"" or low-level ""off"" expression. A second round of promoter design rationally constrained 13 additional positions, leading to a reporter with high-level PhoB-dependent expression, essentially no background, and no other known regulatory elements. As expressed reporters, we used both stable and destabilized variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), the latter of which has a half-life of 81 min in <i>V. fischeri</i> In culture, PhoB induced the reporter when phosphate was depleted to a concentration below 10 M. During symbiotic colonization of its host squid, <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>, the reporter indicated heterogeneous phosphate availability in different light-organ microenvironments. Finally, testing this construct in other members of the <i>Proteobacteria</i> demonstrated its broader utility. The results illustrate how a limited ability to predict synthetic promoter-reporter performance can be overcome through iterative screening and reengineering.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Transcriptional reporters can be powerful tools for assessing when a particular regulator is active; however, native promoters may not be ideal for this purpose. Optimal reporters should be specific to the regulator being examined and should maximize the difference between the ""on"" and ""off"" states; however, these properties are distinct from the selective pressures driving the evolution of natural promoters. Synthetic promoters offer a promising alternative, but our understanding often does not enable fully predictive promoter design, and the large number of alternative sequence possibilities can be intractable. In a synthetic promoter region with over 34 billion sequence variants, we identified bases correlated with favorable performance by screening only 83 candidates, allowing us to rationally constrain our design. We thereby generated an optimized reporter that is induced by PhoB and used it to explore the low-phosphate response of <i>V. fischeri</i> This promoter design strategy will facilitate the engineering of other regulator-specific reporters.",29752265

The goal of this study was to determine whether Cathepsin L, a cysteine protease associated with apoptosis in other animals, plays a critical role in symbiont-induced cell death in the host squid. Sequence analysis and biochemical characterization demonstrated that the protein has key residues and domains essential for Cathepsin L function and that it is active within the pH range typical of these proteases. With in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we localized the transcript and protein, respectively, to cells interacting with V.fischeri. Activity of the protein occurred along the path of symbiont colonization. A specific Cathepsin L, nonspecific cysteine protease, and caspase inhibitor each independently attenuated activity and cell death to varying degrees.

Biofilm formation can be induced by overproduction of the sensor kinase RscS, which requires the activities of the hybrid sensor kinase SypF and the response regulator SypG and is negatively regulated by the sensor kinase BinK. Here, we identify calcium as a signal that promotes biofilm formation by biofilm-competent strains under conditions in which biofilms are not typically observed (growth with shaking). This was true for RscS-overproducing cells as well as for strains in which only the negative regulator <i>binK</i> was deleted. The latter results provided, for the first time, an opportunity to induce and evaluate biofilm formation without regulator overexpression. Using these conditions, we determined that calcium induces both <i>syp</i>-dependent and bacterial cellulose synthesis (<i>bcs</i>)-dependent biofilms at the level of transcription of these loci. The calcium-induced biofilms were dependent on SypF, but SypF's Hpt domain was sufficient for biofilm formation. These data suggested the involvement of another sensor kinase(s) and led to the discovery that both RscS and a previously uncharacterized sensor kinase, HahK, functioned in this pathway.

Using the squid-vibrio system, a model for development of symbiotic partnerships, we examined the modulation of the crumbs gene in host epithelial tissues during initiation and maintenance of the association. The extracellular luminous symbiont Vibrio fischeri colonizes the apical surfaces of polarized epithelia in deep crypts of the Euprymna scolopes light organ. During initial colonization each generation, symbiont harvesting is potentiated by the biochemical and biophysical activity of superficial ciliated epithelia, which are several cell layers from the crypt epithelia where the symbionts reside. Within hours of crypt colonization, the symbionts induce the cell death mediated regression of the remote superficial ciliated fields. However, the crypt cells directly interacting with the symbiont are protected from death. In the squid host, we characterized the gene and encoded protein during light organ morphogenesis and in response to symbiosis. Features of the protein sequence and structure, phylogenetic relationships, and localization patterns in the eye supported assignment of the squid protein to the Crumbs family. In situ hybridization revealed that the crumbs transcript shows opposite expression at the onset of symbiosis in the two different regions of the light organ: elevated levels in the superficial epithelia were attenuated whereas low levels in the crypt epithelia were turned up. Although a rhythmic association in which the host controls the symbiont population over the day-night cycle begins in the juvenile upon colonization, cycling of crumbs was evident only in the adult organ with peak expression coincident with maximum symbiont population and luminescence.

Whole genome sequencing and MLSA analysis revealed that Leisingera sp. JC1 falls within a group of roseobacters associated with squid ANGs. Genome and biochemical analyses revealed the potential for and production of a number of secondary metabolites, including siderophores and acyl-homoserine lactones involved with quorum sensing. The complete biosynthetic gene cluster for the pigment indigoidine was detected in the genome and mass spectrometry confirmed the production of this compound. Furthermore, we investigated the production of indigoidine under co-culture conditions with Vibrio fischeri, the light organ symbiont of E. scolopes, and with other vibrios. Finally, both Leisingera sp. JC1 and secondary metabolite extracts of this strain had differential antimicrobial activity against a number of marine vibrios, suggesting that Leisingera sp.

The symbiosis established between Euprymna scolopes and Vibrio fischeri is a well-characterized host-microbe association in which the function and structure of V. fischeri populations within the host are known: V. fischeri populations produce bioluminescence from distinct crypt spaces within a dedicated host structure called the light organ. Previous studies have revealed that luminescence is required for V. fischeri populations to persist within the light organ and that deletion of the lux gene locus, which is responsible for luminescence in V. fischeri, leads to a persistence defect. In this study, we investigated the impact of bioluminescence on V. fischeri population structure within the light organ. We report that the persistence defect is specific to crypt I, which is the most developmentally mature crypt space within the nascent light organ. This result provides insight into the structure/function relationship that will be useful for future mechanistic studies of squid-Vibrio symbiosis. In addition, our report highlights the potential impact of the host developmental program on the spatiotemporal dynamics of host-microbe interactions. Metazoan development and physiology depend on microbes. The relationship between the symbiotic function of microbes and their spatial structure within the host environment remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate, using a binary symbiosis, that the host requirement for the symbiotic function of the microbial symbiont is restricted to a specific host environment. Our results also suggest a link between microbial function and host development that may be a fundamental aspect of the more complex host-microbe interactions.",27474717

The function of LBPs has been studied principally in the context of host defense; the possible role of LBPs in nonpathogenic host-microbe interactions has not been well characterized. Using the Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri model, we analyzed the structure and function of an LBP family protein, E. scolopes LBP1 (EsLBP1), and provide evidence for its role in triggering a symbiont-induced host developmental program. Previous studies showed that, during initial host colonization, the LPS of V.fischeri synergizes with peptidoglycan (PGN) monomer to induce morphogenesis of epithelial tissues of the host animal. Computationally modeled EsLBP1 shares some but not all structural features of mammalian LBPs that are thought important for LPS binding. Similar to human LBP, recombinant EsLBP1 expressed in insect cells bound V.fischeri LPS and Neisseria meningitidis lipooligosaccharide (LOS) with nanomolar or greater affinity but bound Francisella tularensis LPS only weakly and did not bind PGN monomer. Unlike human LBP, EsLBP1 did not bind N.meningitidis LOS:CD14 complexes. The eslbp1 transcript was upregulated ~22-fold by V.fischeri at 24h postinoculation. Surprisingly, this upregulation was not induced by exposure to LPS but, rather, to the PGN monomer alone. Hybridization chain reaction-fluorescent in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) localized eslbp1 transcript and protein in crypt epithelia, where V.fischeri induces morphogenesis. The data presented here provide a window into the evolution of LBPs and the scope of their roles in animal symbioses. Mammalian lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) is implicated in conveying LPS to host cells and potentiating its signaling activity. In certain disease states, such as obesity, the overproduction of this protein has been a reliable biomarker of chronic inflammation. Here, we describe a symbiosis-induced invertebrate LBP whose tertiary structure and LPS-binding characteristics are similar to those of mammalian LBPs; however, the primary structure of this distantly related squid protein (EsLBP1) differs in key residues previously believed to be essential for LPS binding, suggesting that an alternative strategy exists. Surprisingly, symbiotic expression of eslbp1 is induced by peptidoglycan derivatives, not LPS, a pattern converse to that of RegIII, an important mammalian immunity protein that binds peptidoglycan but whose gene expression is induced by LPS. Finally, EsLBP1 occurs along the apical surfaces of all the host's epithelia, suggesting that it was recruited from a general defensive role to one that mediates specific interactions with its symbiont.",26463160

Biofilm-proficient strains form wrinkled colonies on solid media, while sypA mutants form biofilm-defective smooth colonies. To begin to understand the function of SypA, we used comparative analyses and mutagenesis approaches. sypA (and the syp locus) is conserved in other Vibrios, including two food-borne human pathogens, Vibrio vulnificus (rbdA) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (sypA VP ). We found that both homologs could complement the biofilm defect of the V. fischeri sypA mutant, but their phenotypes varied depending on the biofilm-inducing conditions used. Furthermore, while SypAVP retained an ability to be regulated by SypE, RbdA was resistant to this control. To better understand SypA function, we examined the biofilm-promoting ability of a number of mutant SypA proteins with substitutions in conserved residues, and found many that were biofilm-defective. The most severe biofilm-defective phenotypes occurred when changes were made to a conserved stretch of amino acids within a predicted -helix of SypA; we hypothesize that this region of SypA may interact with another protein to promote biofilm formation. Finally, we identified a residue required for negative control by SypE. Together, our data provide insights into the function of this key biofilm regulator and suggest that the SypA orthologs may play similar roles in their native Vibrio species.",26284045

NagC is a repressor conserved among -proteobacteria that regulates expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc). The polymeric form of GlcNAc, known as chitin, has been shown to play roles in chemotactic signaling and nutrition within the light organ symbiosis established between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes. Here, we investigate the impact of NagC regulation on the physiology of V. fischeri. We find that NagC repression contributes to the fitness of V. fischeri in the absence of GlcNAc. In addition, the inability to de-repress expression of NagC-regulated genes reduces the fitness of V. fischeri in the presence of GlcNAc. We find that chemotaxis toward GlcNAc or chitobiose, a dimeric form of GlcNAc, is independent of NagC regulation. Finally, we show that NagC represses gene expression during the early stages of symbiosis. Our data suggest that the ability to regulate gene expression with NagC contributes to the overall fitness of V. fischeri in environments that vary in levels of GlcNAc. Furthermore, our finding that NagC represses gene expression within the squid light organ during an early stage of symbiosis supports the notion that the ability of the squid to provide a source of GlcNAc emerges later in host development.",26236308

Our laboratory focuses on studying the role of the immune system in the mutualistic relationship between the sepiolid squid, Euprymna scolopes and its bioluminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri.

To understand the molecular determinants of microbiota selection, we examined colonization of a simplified model in which the light organ of Euprymna scolopes squid is colonized exclusively by Vibrio fischeri bacteria. We applied high-throughput insertion sequencing to identify which bacterial genes are required during host colonization. A library of over 41,000 unique transposon insertions was analyzed before and after colonization of 1,500 squid hatchlings. Mutants that were reproducibly depleted following squid colonization represented 380 genes, including 37 that encode known colonization factors. Validation of select mutants in defined competitions against the wild-type strain identified nine mutants that exhibited a reproducible colonization defect. Some of the colonization factors identified included genes predicted to influence copper regulation and secretion. Other mutants exhibited defects in biofilm development, which is required for aggregation in host mucus and initiation of colonization. Biofilm formation in culture and in vivo was abolished in a strain lacking the cytoplasmic chaperone DnaJ, suggesting an important role for protein quality control during the elaboration of bacterial biofilm in the context of an intact host immune system.

Not only does the host have to select V. fischeri from the environment, but it must also prevent subsequent colonization by non-symbiotic microorganisms. Host macrophage-like hemocytes are believed to play a role in mediating the symbiosis with V. fischeri. Previous studies have shown that the colonization state of the light organ influences the host's hemocyte response to the symbiont. To further understand the molecular mechanisms behind this process, we used two quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic techniques, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and label-free spectral counting, to compare and quantify the adult hemocyte proteomes from colonized (sym) and uncolonized (antibiotic-treated/cured) squid. Overall, iTRAQ allowed for the quantification of 1,024 proteins with two or more peptides. Thirty-seven unique proteins were determined to be significantly different between sym and cured hemocytes (p value < 0.05), with 20 more abundant proteins and 17 less abundant in sym hemocytes. The label-free approach resulted in 1,241 proteins that were identified in all replicates. Of 185 unique proteins present at significantly different amounts in sym hemocytes (as determined by spectral counting), 92 were more abundant and 93 were less abundant. Comparisons between iTRAQ and spectral counting revealed that 30 of the 37 proteins quantified via iTRAQ exhibited trends similar to those identified by the label-free method. Both proteomic techniques mutually identified 16 proteins that were significantly different between the two groups of hemocytes (p value < 0.05). The presence of V. fischeri in the host light organ influenced the abundance of proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, adhesion, lysosomes, proteolysis, and the innate immune response. These data provide evidence that colonization by V. fischeri alters the hemocyte proteome and reveals proteins that may be important for maintaining host-symbiont specificity.",25038065

The bioluminescent symbiont Vibrio fischeri encodes two AHL signal synthases: AinS and LuxI. AinS-dependent quorum sensing converges with LuxI-dependent quorum sensing at the LuxR regulatory element. Both AinS- and LuxI-mediated signalling are required for efficient and persistent colonization of the squid host, Euprymna scolopes. The basis of the mutualism is symbiont bioluminescence, which is regulated by both LuxI- and AinS-dependent quorum sensing, and is essential for maintaining a colonization of the host. Here, we used chemical and genetic approaches to probe the dynamics of LuxI- and AinS-mediated regulation of bioluminescence during symbiosis. We demonstrate that both native AHLs and non-native AHL analogues can be used to non-invasively and specifically modulate induction of symbiotic bioluminescence via LuxI-dependent quorum sensing. Our data suggest that the first day of colonization, during which symbiont bioluminescence is induced by LuxIR, is a critical period that determines the stability of the V.fischeri population once symbiosis is established.",24191970

As the eye and light organ originate from different embryonic tissues, we examined whether the eye-specification genes, pax6, eya, six, and dac, are shared by these two organs, and if so, whether they are regulated in the light organ by symbiosis. We obtained sequences of the four genes with PCR, confirmed orthology with phylogenetic analysis, and determined that each was expressed in the eye and light organ. With in situ hybridization (ISH), we localized the gene transcripts in developing embryos, comparing the patterns of expression in the two organs. The four transcripts localized to similar tissues, including those associated with the visual system 1/4 into embryogenesis (Naef stage 18) and the light organ 3/4 into embryogenesis (Naef stage 26). We used ISH and quantitative real-time PCR to examine transcript expression and differential regulation in postembryonic light organs in response to the following colonization conditions: wild-type, luminescent V. fischeri; a mutant strain defective in light production; and as a control, no symbiont. In ISH experiments light organs showed down regulation of the pax6, eya, and six transcripts in response to wild-type V. fischeri. Mutant strains also induced down regulation of the pax6 and eya transcripts, but not of the six transcript. Thus, luminescence was required for down regulation of the six transcript. We discuss these results in the context of symbiont-induced light-organ development. Our study indicates that the eye-specification genes are expressed in light-interacting tissues independent of their embryonic origin and are capable of responding to bacterial cues.

Formation of this biofilm is induced by the sensor kinase RscS, which functions upstream of the response regulator SypG to regulate transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) locus. Biofilm formation is also controlled by SypE, a multi-domain response regulator that consists of a central regulatory receiver (REC) domain flanked by an N-terminal serine kinase domain and a C-terminal serine phosphatase domain. SypE permits biofilm formation under rscS overexpression conditions, but inhibits biofilms induced by overexpression of sypG. We previously investigated the function of SypE in controlling biofilm formation induced by RscS. Here, we examined the molecular mechanism by which SypE naturally inhibits SypG-induced biofilms. We found that SypE's N-terminal kinase domain was both required and sufficient to inhibit SypG-induced biofilms. This effect did not occur at the level of syp transcription. Instead, under sypG-overexpressing conditions, SypE inhibited biofilms by promoting the phosphorylation of another syp regulator, SypA, a putative anti-sigma factor antagonist. Inhibition by SypE of SypG-induced biofilm formation could be overcome by the expression of a non-phosphorylatable SypA mutant, indicating that SypE functions primarily if not exclusively to control SypA activity via phosphorylation. Finally, the presence of SypE was detrimental to colonization under sypG-overexpressing conditions, as cells deleted for sypE outcompeted wild-type cells for colonization when both strains overexpressed sypG. These results provide further evidence that biofilm formation is critical to symbiotic colonization, and support a model in which SypE naturally functions to restrict biofilm formation, and thus host colonization, to the appropriate environmental conditions.",23555890

In this study, we sought to determine whether symbionts affect host transcriptional rhythms. We identified two transcripts in host tissues (E. scolopes cry1 [escry1] and escry2) that encode cryptochromes, proteins that influence circadian rhythms in other systems. Both genes cycled daily in the head of the squid, with a pattern similar to that of other animals, in which expression of certain cry genes is entrained by environmental light. In contrast, escry1 expression cycled in the symbiont-colonized light organ with 8-fold upregulation coincident with the rhythms of bacterial luminescence, which are offset from the day/night light regime. Colonization of the juvenile light organ by symbionts was required for induction of escry1 cycling. Further, analysis with a mutant strain defective in light production showed that symbiont luminescence is essential for cycling of escry1; this defect could be complemented by presentation of exogenous blue light. However, blue-light exposure alone did not induce cycling in nonsymbiotic animals, but addition of molecules of the symbiont cell envelope to light-exposed animals did recover significant cycling activity, showing that light acts in synergy with other symbiont features to induce cycling.

The syp locus includes 18 genes that can be classified into four groups based on putative function: 4 genes encode putative regulators, 6 encode glycosyltransferases, 2 encode export proteins, and the remaining 6 encode proteins with other functions, including polysaccharide modification. To understand the roles of each of the 14 structural syp genes in colonization and biofilm formation, we generated nonpolar in-frame deletions of each gene. All of the deletion mutants exhibited defects in their ability to colonize juvenile squid, although the impact of the loss of SypB or SypI was modest. Consistent with their requirement for colonization, most of the structural genes were also required for RscS-induced biofilm formation. In particular, the production of wrinkled colonies, pellicles, and the matrix on the colony surface was eliminated or severely decreased in all mutants except for the sypB and sypI mutants; in contrast, only a subset of genes appeared to play a role in attachment to glass. Finally, immunoblotting data suggested that the structural Syp proteins are involved in polysaccharide production and/or export.

Previous work has shown that AinS/R-directed quorum sensing also regulates the expression of rpoQ (VF_A1015), a gene annotated as an RpoS-like sigma factor. In this study, we demonstrate using phylogenetics that RpoQ is related to, but distinct from, the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. Overexpression of rpoQ results in elevated chitinase activity but decreased motility and luminescence, three activities associated with symbiosis. The reduction in bacterial luminescence associated with the overexpression of rpoQ occurs both in culture and within the light-emitting organ of the squid host. This suppression of bioluminescence is due to the repression of the luxICDABEG promoter. Our results highlight RpoQ as a novel regulatory component, embedded in the quorum-signaling network that controls several biological processes in V. fischeri. Quorum signaling is a widely occurring phenomenon that functions in diverse bacterial taxa. It is most often found associated with species that interact with animal or plant hosts, either as mutualists or pathogens, and controls the expression of genes critical to tissue colonization. We present the discovery of rpoQ, which encodes a new regulatory component in the quorum-signaling pathway of Vibrio fischeri. RpoQ is a novel protein in the RpoS family of stationary-phase sigma factors. Unlike many other regulatory proteins involved in the quorum-signaling pathways of the Vibrionaceae, the distribution of RpoQ appears to be restricted to only two closely related species. The role of this regulator is to enhance some quorum-signaling outputs (motility) while suppressing others (luminescence). We propose that RpoQ may be a recently evolved or acquired component in V. fischeri that provides this organism with an additional level of regulation to modulate its existing quorum-signaling pathway.",22233679

GFP-based reporter assays revealed that gene cluster promoter activity is induced in symbiotic V. fischeri as early as 14 h post inoculation, although colonization assays with the haem uptake mutant suggested an inability to uptake haem does not begin to limit colonization until later stages of the symbiosis. Our data indicate that the squid light organ is a low iron environment and that haem-based sources of iron are used by symbiotic V. fischeri cells. These findings provide important additional information on the availability of iron during symbiotic colonization of E. scolopes by V. fischeri, as well as the role of haem uptake in non-pathogenic host-microbe interactions.",21883801

This biofilm depends on the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) locus, which is transcriptionally regulated by the RscS-SypG two-component regulatory system. An additional response regulator (RR), SypE, exerts both positive and negative control over biofilm formation. SypE is a novel RR protein, with its three putative domains arranged in a unique configuration: a central phosphorylation receiver (REC) domain flanked by two effector domains with putative enzymatic activities (serine kinase and serine phosphatase). To determine how SypE regulates biofilm formation and host colonization, we generated a library of SypE domain mutants. Our results indicate that the N-terminus inhibits biofilm formation, while the C-terminus plays a positive role. The phosphorylation state of SypE appears to regulate these opposing activities, as disruption of the putative site of phosphorylation results in a protein that constitutively inhibits biofilm formation. Furthermore, SypE restricts host colonization: (i) sypE mutants with constitutive inhibitory activity fail to efficiently initiate host colonization and (ii) loss of sypE partially alleviates the colonization defect of an rscS mutant. We conclude that SypE must be inactivated to promote symbiotic colonization by V. fischeri.",21854462

In the symbiosis between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its host squid, Euprymna scolopes, colonization proceeds via a transient biofilm formed by the bacterium. The production of this bacterial biofilm depends on a complex regulatory network that controls transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) gene locus. In addition to this transcriptional control, biofilm formation is regulated by two proteins, SypA and SypE, which may function in an unusual regulatory mechanism known as partner switching. Best characterized in Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria, partner switching is a signalling mechanism that provides dynamic regulatory control over bacterial gene expression. The involvement of putative partner-switching components within V. fischeri suggests that tight regulatory control over biofilm formation may be important for the lifestyle of this organism.",21966901

During the early stages of colonization, V. fischeri is exposed to host-derived nitric oxide (NO). Although NO can be both an antimicrobial component of innate immunity and a key signaling molecule in eukaryotes, potential roles in beneficial host-microbe associations have not been described. V. fischeri hnoX encodes a heme NO/oxygen-binding (H-NOX) protein, a member of a family of bacterial NO- and/or O(2)-binding proteins of unknown function. We hypothesized that H-NOX acts as a NO sensor that is involved in regulating symbiosis-related genes early in colonization. Whole-genome expression studies identified 20 genes that were repressed in an NO- and H-NOX-dependent fashion. Ten of these, including hemin-utilization genes, have a promoter with a putative ferric-uptake regulator (Fur) binding site. As predicted, in the presence of NO, wild-type V. fischeri grew more slowly on hemin than a hnoX deletion mutant. Host-colonization studies showed that the hnoX mutant was also 10-fold more efficient in initially colonizing the squid host than the wild type; similarly, in mixed inoculations, it outcompeted the wild-type strain by an average of 16-fold after 24 h. However, the presence of excess hemin or iron reversed this dominance. The advantage of the mutant in colonizing the iron-limited light-organ tissues is caused, at least in part, by its greater ability to acquire host-derived hemin. Our data suggest that V. fischeri normally senses a host-generated NO signal through H-NOX(Vf) and modulates the expression of its iron uptake capacity during the early stages of the light-organ symbiosis.",20404170

To test for FNR-mediated regulation of bioluminescence and anaerobic respiration in V. fischeri, we generated fnr mutants of V. fischeri strains MJ1 and ES114. In both strains, FNR was required for normal fumarate- and nitrate-dependent respiration. However, contrary to the report in transgenic E. coli, FNR mediated the repression of lux. ArcA represses bioluminescence, and P(arcA)-lacZ reporters showed reduced expression in fnr mutants, suggesting a possible indirect effect of FNR on bioluminescence via arcA.

We describe here the transcriptional, metabolic, and ultrastructural characteristics of a diel rhythm that occurs in the symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The rhythm is driven by the host's expulsion from its light-emitting organ of most of the symbiont population each day at dawn. The transcriptomes of both the host epithelium that supports the symbionts and the symbiont population itself were characterized and compared at four times over this daily cycle. The greatest fluctuation in gene expression of both partners occurred as the day began. Most notable was an up-regulation in the host of >50 cytoskeleton-related genes just before dawn and their subsequent down-regulation within 6 h. Examination of the epithelium by TEM revealed a corresponding restructuring, characterized by effacement and blebbing of its apical surface. After the dawn expulsion, the epithelium reestablished its polarity, and the residual symbionts began growing, repopulating the light organ. Analysis of the symbiont transcriptome suggested that the bacteria respond to the effacement by up-regulating genes associated with anaerobic respiration of glycerol; supporting this finding, lipid analysis of the symbionts' membranes indicated a direct incorporation of host-derived fatty acids. After 12 h, the metabolic signature of the symbiont population shifted to one characteristic of chitin fermentation, which continued until the following dawn. Thus, the persistent maintenance of the squid-vibrio symbiosis is tied to a dynamic diel rhythm that involves both partners.",20133870

Vibrio fischeri has the capacity to produce at least two distinct types of biofilms, one that relies on the symbiosis polysaccharide Syp and another that depends upon cellulose. A key regulator of biofilm formation in bacteria is the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). In this study, we focused on a predicted c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase encoded by the gene binA, located directly downstream of syp, a cluster of 18 genes critical for biofilm formation and the initiation of symbiotic colonization of the squid Euprymna scolopes. Disruption or deletion of binA increased biofilm formation in culture and led to increased binding of Congo red and calcofluor, which are indicators of cellulose production. Using random transposon mutagenesis, we determined that the phenotypes of the DeltabinA mutant strain could be disrupted by insertions in genes in the bacterial cellulose biosynthesis cluster (bcs), suggesting that cellulose production is negatively regulated by BinA. Replacement of critical amino acids within the conserved EAL residues of the EAL domain disrupted BinA activity, and deletion of binA increased c-di-GMP levels in the cell. Together, these data support the hypotheses that BinA functions as a phosphodiesterase and that c-di-GMP activates cellulose biosynthesis. Finally, overexpression of the syp regulator sypG induced binA expression. Thus, this work reveals a mechanism by which V. fischeri inhibits cellulose-dependent biofilm formation and suggests that the production of two different polysaccharides may be coordinated through the action of the cellulose inhibitor BinA.",20061475

This is the case, for example, in the symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the squid Euprymna scolopes, which proceeds via a biofilm-like bacterial aggregation, followed by entry and growth. A key regulator, the sensor kinase RscS, is critical for symbiotic biofilm formation and colonization. When introduced into a fish symbiont strain that naturally lacks the rscS gene and cannot colonize squid, RscS permits colonization, thereby extending the host range of these bacteria. RscS controls biofilm formation by inducing transcription of the symbiosis polysaccharide (syp) gene locus. Transcription of syp also requires the sigma(54)-dependent activator SypG, which functions downstream of RscS. In addition to these regulators, SypE, a response regulator that lacks an apparent DNA binding domain, exerts both positive and negative control over biofilm formation. The putative sensor kinase SypF and the putative response regulator VpsR, both of which contribute to control of cellulose production, also influence biofilm formation.

To explore the interplay between these two roles, we characterized a PGRP in the host squid Euprymna scolopes (EsPGRP1) during colonization by the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Previous research on the squid-vibrio symbiosis had shown that, upon colonization of deep epithelium-lined crypts of the host light organ, symbiont-derived peptidoglycan monomers induce apoptosis-mediated regression of remote epithelial fields involved in the inoculation process. In this study, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that EsPGRP1 localizes to the nuclei of epithelial cells, and symbiont colonization induces the loss of EsPGRP1 from apoptotic nuclei. The loss of nuclear EsPGRP1 occurred prior to DNA cleavage and breakdown of the nuclear membrane, but followed chromatin condensation, suggesting that it occurs during late-stage apoptosis. Experiments with purified peptidoglycan monomers and with V. fischeri mutants defective in peptidoglycan-monomer release provided evidence that these molecules trigger nuclear loss of EsPGRP1 and apoptosis. The demonstration of a nuclear PGRP is unprecedented, and the dynamics of EsPGRP1 during apoptosis provide a striking example of a connection between microbial recognition and developmental responses in the establishment of symbiosis.",19416268

Because the crypt interior remains in contact with seawater, the squid must not only foster the specific symbiosis, but also continue to exclude other bacteria. Investigation of the role of the innate immune system in these processes revealed that macrophage-like haemocytes isolated from E. scolopes recognized and phagocytosed V. fischeri less than other closely related bacterial species common to the host's environment. Interestingly, phagocytes isolated from hosts that had been cured of their symbionts bound five times more V. fischeri cells than those from uncured hosts. No such change in the ability to bind other species of bacteria was observed, suggesting that the host adapts specifically to V. fischeri. Deletion of the gene encoding OmpU, the major outer membrane protein of V. fischeri, increased binding by haemocytes from uncured animals to the level observed for haemocytes from cured animals. Co-incubation with wild-type V. fischeri reduced this binding, suggesting that they produce a factor that complements the mutant's defect. Analyses of the phagocytosis of bound cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting indicated that once binding to haemocytes had occurred, V. fischeri cells are phagocytosed as effectively as other bacteria. Thus, discrimination by this component of the squid immune system occurs at the level of haemocyte binding, and this response: (i) is modified by previous exposure to the symbiont and (ii) relies on outer membrane and/or secreted components of the symbionts. These data suggest that regulation of host haemocyte binding by the symbiont may be one of many factors that contribute to specificity in this association.",19196278

Often, symbionts must be acquired from the environment during each generation, and identification of the relevant symbiotic partner against a myriad of unwanted relationships is a formidable task. Although examples of this specificity are well-documented, the genetic mechanisms governing it are poorly characterized. Here we show that the two-component sensor kinase RscS is necessary and sufficient for conferring efficient colonization of Euprymna scolopes squid by bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri from the North Pacific Ocean. In the squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114, RscS controls light-organ colonization by inducing the Syp exopolysaccharide, a mediator of biofilm formation during initial infection. A genome-level comparison revealed that rscS, although present in squid symbionts, is absent from the fish symbiont V. fischeri MJ11. We found that heterologous expression of RscS in strain MJ11 conferred the ability to colonize E. scolopes in a manner comparable to that of natural squid isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support an important role for rscS in the evolution of the squid symbiosis. Our results demonstrate that a regulatory gene can alter the host range of animal-associated bacteria. We show that, by encoding a regulator and not an effector that interacts directly with the host, a single gene can contribute to the evolution of host specificity by switching 'on' pre-existing capabilities for interaction with animal tissue.",19182778

To determine the genetic basis of these events, a glass-slide microarray was used to characterize the light-organ transcriptome of juvenile squid in response to the initiation of symbiosis. Patterns of gene expression were compared between animals not exposed to the symbiont, exposed to the wild-type symbiont, or exposed to a mutant symbiont defective in either of two key characters of this association: bacterial luminescence or autoinducer (AI) production. Hundreds of genes were differentially regulated as a result of symbiosis initiation, and a hierarchy existed in the magnitude of the host's response to three symbiont features: bacterial presence > luminescence > AI production. Putative host receptors for bacterial surface molecules known to induce squid development are up-regulated by symbiont light production, suggesting that bioluminescence plays a key role in preparing the host for bacteria-induced development. Further, because the transcriptional response of tissues exposed to AI in the natural context (i.e., with the symbionts) differed from that to AI alone, the presence of the bacteria potentiates the role of quorum signals in symbiosis. Comparison of these microarray data with those from other symbioses, such as germ-free/conventionalized mice and zebrafish, revealed a set of shared genes that may represent a core set of ancient host responses conserved throughout animal evolution.",18682555

The genome sequence of Vibrio fischeri revealed three putative TMAO reductase operons, and a previous report identified TMAO reductase activity in symbiotic V. fischeri isolates associated with the light organs of adult Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. We examined the roles and regulation of these three operons using mutational analyses and promoter-reporter fusions. We found that the torECA promoter, and to a lesser extent the torYZ and dmsABC promoters, were active during symbiotic colonization of juvenile E. scolopes; however, a V. fischeri strain lacking TMAO reductase activity displays no discernible colonization defect over the first 48 h. Our studies also revealed that torECA has the most active promoter of the putative TMAO reductase operons, and TorECA is the major contributor to TMAO-dependent growth in V. fischeri under the conditions tested. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulation of TMAO reductase operons in V. fischeri appears to differ from that in previously studied organisms, such as Escherichia coli, which may reflect differences in gene arrangement and bacterial habitat.

For example, pilin expression has been observed to cause subtle variation in colonization for a number of Gram-negative bacteria with eukaryotic hosts. To investigate variation amongst pil genes of closely related strains of vibrios, we amplified pil genes A, B, C and D to determine orientation and sequence similarity to other symbiotic vibrios. The pilA gene was found to be upstream from all other pil genes, and not contiguous with the rest of the operon. The pilB, pilC and pilD loci were flanked at the 3' end by yacE, followed by a conserved hypothetical gene. DNA sequences of each pil gene were aligned and analysed phylogenetically using parsimony for both individual and combined gene trees. Results demonstrate that certain pil loci (pilB and pilD) are conserved among strains of V. fischeri, but pilC differs in sequence between symbiotic and free-living strains. Phylogenetic analysis of all pil genes gives better resolution of Indo-west Pacific V. fischeri symbionts compared with analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.

Previous tests of these models have proven inconclusive, partly because they compared nonisogenic strains, or undefined and/or pleiotropic mutants. To test the influence of the bioluminescence-producing lux operon on growth and symbiotic competence, we generated dark luxCDABEG mutants in strains MJ1 and ES114 without disrupting the luxR-luxI regulatory circuit. The MJ1 luxCDABEG mutant out-competed its visibly luminescent parent approximately 26% per generation in a carbon-limited chemostat. Similarly, induction of luminescence in the otherwise dim ES114 strain slowed growth relative to DeltaluxCDABEG mutants. Some culture conditions yielded no detectable effect of luminescence on growth, indicating that luminescence is not always growth limiting; however, luminescence was never found to confer an advantage in culture. In contrast to this conditional disadvantage of lux expression, ES114 achieved approximately fourfold higher populations than its luxCDABEG mutant in the light organ of E. scolopes.

We investigated how Vibrio fischeri ES114 utilizes cellobiose and found a cluster of genes required for growth on this beta-1,4-linked glucose disaccharide. This cluster includes genes annotated as a phosphotransferase system II (celA, celB, and celC), a glucokinase (celK), and a glucosidase (celG). Directly downstream of celCBGKA is celI, which encodes a LacI family regulator that represses cel transcription in the absence of cellobiose. When the celCBGKAI gene cluster was transferred to cellobiose-negative strains of Vibrio and Photobacterium, the cluster conferred the ability to utilize cellobiose. Genomic analyses of naturally cellobiose-positive Vibrio species revealed that V. salmonicida has a homolog of the celCBGKAI cluster, but V. vulnificus does not. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses revealed that CelG and CelK share the greatest homology with glucosidases and glucokinases in the phylum Firmicutes. These observations suggest that distinct genes for cellobiose utilization have been acquired by different lineages within the family Vibrionaceae. In addition, the loss of the celI regulator, but not the structural genes, attenuated the ability of V. fischeri to compete for colonization of its natural host, Euprymna scolopes, suggesting that repression of the cel gene cluster is important in this symbiosis. Finally, we show that the V. fischeri cellobioase (CelG) preferentially cleaves beta-d-glucose linkages but also cleaves beta-d-galactose-linked substrates such as 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside (X-gal), a finding that has important implications for the use of lacZ as a marker or reporter gene in V. fischeri.",18487409

In examining the latter requirement, we found that during growth in a glycerol/tryptone-based medium, wild-type V. fischeri cells initially excrete acetate but, in a metabolic shift termed the acetate switch, they subsequently utilize the acetate, removing it from the medium. In contrast, an ainS mutant strain grown in this medium does not remove the excreted acetate, which accumulates to lethal levels. The acetate switch is characterized by the induction of acs, the gene encoding acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase, leading to uptake of the excreted acetate. Wild-type cells induce an acs transcriptional reporter 25-fold, coincident with the disappearance of the extracellular acetate; in contrast, the ainS mutant did not display significant induction of the acs reporter. Supplementation of the medium of an ainS mutant with octanoyl-HSL restored normal levels of acs induction and acetate uptake. Additional mutant analyses indicated that acs regulation was accomplished through the regulator LitR but was independent of the LuxIR quorum-signaling pathway. Importantly, the acs mutant of V. fischeri has a competitive defect when colonizing the squid, indicating the importance of proper control of acetate metabolism in the light of organ symbiosis.

SypF1-mediated transcription of the syp cluster was entirely dependent on SypG. However, the biofilm phenotypes were reduced, not eliminated, in the sypG mutant. These phenotypes were also reduced in a mutant deleted for sypE, another syp-encoded response regulator. However, SypF1 still induced phenotypes in a sypG sypE double mutant, suggesting that SypF1 might activate another regulator(s).

However, only the syp-encoded symbiosis regulator SypG was required for both biofilm phenotypes and syp transcription induced by RscS. These data support the hypothesis that RscS functions upstream of SypG to induce biofilm formation. In addition, this work also revealed a role for the syp-encoded RR SypE in biofilm formation. To our knowledge, no other study has used a large-scale epistasis approach to elucidate two-component signaling pathways.

These mutations also affected sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate, kanamycin, and polymyxin, consistent with changes in membrane permeability. Conversely, htrB1 is located on the smaller, more variable vibrio chromosome 2, and an htrB1 mutant was wild-type-like in culture but appeared attenuated in initiating the symbiosis and was outcompeted 2.7-fold during colonization when mixed with the parent.

In this study, microscopic examination of various squid tissues revealed that host hemocytes specifically migrate into the epithelial fields on the surface of the light organ, a process that begins before any other indication of symbiont-induced morphogenesis. Experimental manipulations of symbiont-signal delivery revealed that hemocyte infiltration alone is not sufficient to induce regression, and high numbers of hemocytes are not necessary for the induction of apoptosis or the initiation of regression. However, studies with mutant strains of V. fischeri that show a defect in the induction of hemocyte infiltration provided evidence that high numbers of hemocytes facilitate the regression of the epithelial fields.

Interactions with the symbiont result in the loss of a complex ciliated epithelium dedicated to promoting colonization of host tissue, and some or all of this loss is due to widespread, symbiont-induced apoptosis. Members of the p53 family, including p53, p63, and p73, are conserved across broad phyletic lines and p63 is thought to be the ancestral gene. These proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis and developmental morphogenesis. In this study, we characterized p63-like transcripts from mRNA isolated from the symbiotic tissues of E. scolopes and described their role in symbiont-induced morphogenesis. Using degenerate RT-PCR and RACE PCR, we identified two p63-like transcripts encoding proteins of 431 and 567 amino acids. These transcripts shared identical nucleotides where they overlapped, suggesting that they are splice variants of the same gene. Immunocytochemistry and Western blots using an antibody specific for E. scolopes suggested that the p53 family members are activated in cells of the symbiont-harvesting structures of the symbiotic light organ. We propose that once the symbiosis is initiated, a symbiont-induced signal activates p53 family members, inducing apoptosis and developmental morphogenesis of the light organ.",16946237

This growing awareness has been a driving force for the development of models for the study of beneficial animal-bacterial interactions. In the squid-vibrio model, symbiotic Vibrio fischeri induce dramatic developmental changes in the light organ of host Euprymna scolopes over the first hours to days of their partnership. We report here the creation of a juvenile light-organ specific EST database. We generated eleven cDNA libraries from the light organ of E. scolopes at developmentally significant time points with and without colonization by V. fischeri. Single pass 3' sequencing efforts generated 42,564 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of which 35,421 passed our quality criteria and were then clustered via the UIcluster program into 13,962 nonredundant sequences. The cDNA clones representing these nonredundant sequences were sequenced from the 5' end of the vector and 58% of these resulting sequences overlapped significantly with the associated 3' sequence to generate 8,067 contigs with an average sequence length of 1,065 bp. All sequences were annotated with BLASTX (E-value < -03) and Gene Ontology (GO). Both the number of ESTs generated from each library and GO categorizations are reflective of the activity state of the light organ during these early stages of symbiosis. Future analyses of the sequences identified in these libraries promise to provide valuable information not only about pathways involved in colonization and early development of the squid light organ, but also about pathways conserved in response to bacterial colonization across the animal kingdom.",16780587

The large plasmids share homology with pES100, which is the lone plasmid in V. fischeri type strain ES114. pES100 appears to encode a conjugative system similar to that on plasmid R721. The small plasmids lack extensive similarity to pES100, but they almost always occur in cells that also harbor a large plasmid resembling pES100. We found that many or all of these small plasmids share homology with pES213, a plasmid in strain ES213. We determined the 5501-bp pES213 sequence and generated selectable antibiotic resistance encoding pES213 derivatives, which enabled us to examine replication, retention, and transfer in V. fischeri. An 863-bp fragment of pES213 with features characteristic of theta-type replicons conferred replication without requiring any pES213 open reading frame (ORF). We estimated that pES213 derivatives were maintained at 9.4 copies per genome, which corresponds well with a model of random plasmid segregation to daughter cells and the approximately 10(-4) per generation frequency of plasmid loss. pES213 derivatives mobilized between V. fischeri strains at frequencies up to approximately 10(-4) in culture and in the host, apparently by employing the pES100 conjugative apparatus. pES213 carries two homologs of the putative pES100 origin of transfer (oriT), and V. fischeri strains lacking the pES100 conjugative relaxase, including a relaxase mutant, failed to serve as donors for transmission of pES213 derivatives. In other systems, genes directing conjugative transfer can function in trans to oriT, so it was noteworthy that ORFs adjacent to oriT, VFB51 in pES100 and traYZ in pES213, enhanced transfer 100- to 1000-fold when provided in cis. We also identified and disrupted the V. fischeri recA gene. RecA was not required for stable pES213 replication but surprisingly was required in donors for efficient transfer of pES213 derivatives.

To understand the genetic requirements for this association, we searched a library of V. fischeri transposon insertion mutants for those that failed to colonize E. scolopes. We identified four mutants that exhibited severe defects in initiating colonization. Sequence analysis revealed that the strains contained insertions in four different members of a cluster of 21 genes oriented in the same direction. The predicted gene products are similar to proteins involved in capsule, exopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, including six putative glycosyltransferases. We constructed mutations in five additional genes and found that they also were required for symbiosis. Therefore, we have termed this region syp, for symbiosis polysaccharide. Homologous clusters also exist in Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus, and thus these genes may represent a common mechanism for promoting bacteria-host interactions. Using lacZ reporter fusions, we observed that transcription of the syp genes did not occur under standard laboratory conditions, but could be induced by multicopy expression of sypG, which encodes a response regulator with a predicted sigma54 interaction domain. This induction depended on sigma54, as a mutation in rpoN abolished syp transcription. Primer extension analysis supported the use of putative sigma54 binding sites upstream of sypA, sypI and sypM as promoters. Finally, we found that multicopy expression of sypG resulted in robust biofilm formation. This work thus reveals a novel group of genes that V. fischeri controls through a sigma54-dependent response regulator and uses to promote symbiotic colonization.",16102015

We have demonstrated previously that the ain system activates luminescence gene expression at lower cell densities than those required for lux system activation and that both systems are essential for persistent colonization of the squid host, Euprymna scolopes. Here, we asked whether the relative contributions of the two systems are also important at different colonization stages. Inactivation of ain, but not lux, quorum-sensing genes delayed initiation of the symbiotic relationship. In addition, our data suggest that lux quorum sensing is not fully active in the early stages of colonization, implying that this system is not required until later in the symbiosis. The V. fischeri luxI mutant does not express detectable light levels in symbiosis yet initiates colonization as well as the wild type, suggesting that ain quorum sensing regulates colonization factors other than luminescence. We used a recently developed V. fischeri microarray to identify genes that are controlled by ain quorum sensing and could be responsible for the initiation defect. We found 30 differentially regulated genes, including the repression of a number of motility genes. Consistent with these data, ain quorum-sensing mutants displayed an altered motility behavior in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that the sequential activation of these two quorum-sensing systems with increasing cell density allows the specific regulation of early colonization factors (e.g., motility) by ain quorum sensing, whereas late colonization factors (e.g., luminescence) are preferentially regulated by lux quorum sensing.",15901683

Because motility is essential for initiating colonization, we have begun to identify stage-specific motility requirements by creating flagellar mutants that have symbiotic defects. V. fischeri has six flagellin genes that are uniquely arranged in two chromosomal loci, flaABCDE and flaF. With the exception of the flaA product, the predicted gene products are more similar to each other than to flagellins of other Vibrio species. Immunoblot analysis indicated that only five of the six predicted proteins were present in purified flagella, suggesting that one protein, FlaF, is unique with respect to either its regulation or its function. We created mutations in two genes, flaA and flaC. Compared to a flaC mutant, which has wild-type flagellation, a strain having a mutation in the flaA gene has fewer flagella per cell and exhibits a 60% decrease in its rate of migration in soft agar. During induction of light organ symbiosis, colonization by the flaA mutant is impaired, and this mutant is severely outcompeted when it is presented to the animal as a mixed inoculum with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, flaA mutant cells are preferentially expelled from the animal, suggesting either that FlaA plays a role in adhesion or that normal motility is an advantage for retention within the host. Taken together, these results show that the flagellum of V. fischeri is a complex structure consisting of multiple flagellin subunits, including FlaA, which is essential both for normal flagellation and for motility, as well as for effective symbiotic colonization.",15205434

We have previously demonstrated that the ain system induces luminescence at cell densities that precede lux system activation. Our data suggested that the ain system both relieves repression and initially induces the lux system, thereby achieving sequential induction of gene expression by these two systems. Analysis of the V. fischeri genome revealed the presence of a putative third system based on the enzyme LuxS, which catalyzes the synthesis of the Vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2 (AI-2). In this study, we investigated the impact of V. fischeri LuxS on luminescence and colonization competence in comparison to that of the ain system. Similar to the ain system, inactivation of the AI-2 system decreased light production in culture, but not in the squid host. However, while an ainS mutant produces no detectable light in culture, a luxS mutant expressed approximately 70% of wild-type luminescence levels. A mutation in luxS alone did not compromise symbiotic competence of V. fischeri; however, levels of colonization of an ainS luxS double mutant were reduced to 50% of the already diminished level of ainS mutant colonization, suggesting that these two systems regulate colonization gene expression synergistically through a common pathway. Introduction of a luxO mutation into the luxS and ainS luxS background could relieve both luminescence and colonization defects, consistent with a model in which LuxS, like AinS, regulates gene expression through LuxO. Furthermore, while luxS transcription appeared to be constitutive and the AI-2 signal concentration did not change dramatically, our data suggest that ainS transcription is autoregulated, resulting in an over 2,000-fold increase in signal concentration as culture density increased. Taken together, these data indicate that V. fischeri LuxS affects both luminescence regulation and colonization competence; however, its quantitative contribution is small when compared to that of the AinS signal.",15175301

Using as a model the symbiotic association of the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri with its animal host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, we investigated the role of GacA in this beneficial animal-microbe interaction. When grown in culture, gacA mutants were defective in several traits important for symbiosis, including luminescence, growth in defined media, growth yield, siderophore activity, and motility. However, gacA mutants were not deficient in production of acylated homoserine lactone signals or catalase activity. The ability of the gacA mutants to initiate squid colonization was impaired but not abolished, and they reached lower-than-wild-type population densities within the host light organ. In contrast to their dark phenotype in culture, gacA mutants that reached population densities above the luminescence detection limit had normal levels of luminescence per bacterial cell in squid light organs, indicating that GacA is not required for light production within the host. The gacA mutants were impaired at competitive colonization and could only successfully cocolonize squid light organs when present in the seawater at higher inoculum densities than wild-type bacteria. Although severely impaired during colonization initiation, gacA mutants were not displaced by the wild-type strain in light organs that were colonized with both strains.

We have investigated the impact of the V. fischeri acyl-HSL synthase AinS on both luminescence and symbiotic colonization. Through phenotypic studies of V. fischeri mutants we have found that the AinS-signal is the predominant inducer of luminescence expression in culture, whereas the impact of the LuxI-signal is apparent only at the high cell densities occurring in symbiosis. Furthermore, our studies revealed that ainS regulates activities essential for successful colonization of E. scolopes, i.e. the V. fischeri ainS mutant failed to persist in the squid light organ. Mutational inactivation of the transcriptional regulator protein LuxO in the ainS mutant partially or completely reversed all the observed phenotypes, demonstrating that the AinS-signal regulates expression of downstream genes through the inactivation of LuxO.

Genetic arrangement of the flrA locus in V. fischeri is similar to motility master-regulator operons of Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In addition, examination of regulatory regions of a number of flagellar operons in V. fischeri revealed apparent sigma(54) recognition motifs, suggesting that the flagellar regulatory hierarchy is controlled by a similar mechanism to that described in V. cholerae. However, in contrast to its closest known relatives, flrA mutant strains of V. fischeri ES114 were completely abolished in swimming capability. Although flrA provided in trans restored motility to the flrA mutant, the complemented strain was unable to reach wild-type levels of symbiotic colonization in juvenile squid, suggesting a possible role for the proper expression of FlrA in regulating symbiotic colonization factors in addition to those required for motility. Comparative RNA arbitrarily primed PCR analysis of the flrA mutant and its wild-type parent revealed several differentially expressed transcripts. These results define a regulon that includes both flagellar structural genes and other genes apparently not involved in flagellum elaboration or function.

Hatchling squid lack these bacterial symbionts, and V. fischeri strains must compete to occupy this privileged niche. We cloned a V. fischeri gene, designated pilA, that contributes to colonization competitiveness and encodes a protein similar to type IV-A pilins. Unlike its closest known relatives, Vibrio cholerae mshA and vcfA, pilA is monocistronic and not clustered with genes associated with pilin export or assembly. Using wild-type strain ES114 as the parent, we generated an in-frame pilA deletion mutant, as well as pilA mutants marked with a kanamycin resistance gene. In mixed inocula, marked mutants were repeatedly outcompeted by ES114 (P < 0.05) but not by an unmarked pilA mutant, for squid colonization. In contrast, the ratio of mutant to ES114 CFUs did not change during 70 generations of coculturing. The competitive defect of pilA mutants ranged from 1.7- to 10-fold and was more pronounced when inocula were within the range estimated for V. fischeri populations in Hawaiian seawater (200 to 2,000 cells/ml) than when higher densities were used. ES114 also outcompeted a pilA mutant by an average of twofold at lower inoculum densities, when only a fraction of the squid became infected, most by only one strain. V. fischeri strain ET101, which was isolated from Euprymna tasmanica and is outcompeted by ES114, lacks pilA; however, 11 other diverse V. fischeri isolates apparently possess pilA.

The role of this locus in the growth physiology of Vibrio fischeri, and in the symbiotic colonization of the squid Euprymna scolopes was investigated. In rich medium, a V. fischeri sapA insertion mutant grew at only 85% the rate of its wild-type parent. While a similar effect has been attributed to a potassium-transport defect in sap mutants of enteric bacteria, the V. fischeri mutant grew more slowly regardless of the potassium concentration of the medium. Similarly, the growth-rate defect was independent of the source of either carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorous, indicating that the V. fischeri sap genes do not encode functions required for the transport of a specific form of any of these nutrients. Finally, while a delay in colonizing the nascent light organ of the squid could be accounted for by the lower growth rate of the mutant, a small but statistically significant reduction in its final population size in the host, but not in medium, suggests that the sap genes play another role in the symbiosis. All of these phenotypic defects could be genetically complemented in trans by the sapABCDF genes, but not by the sapA gene alone, indicating that the insertion in sapA is polar to the four downstream genes in the locus. Thus, while the sap locus is important to the normal growth of V. fischeri, it plays different physiological roles in growth and tissue colonization than it does in enteric pathogens.",12471505

In a screen for V. fischeri colonization mutants, we identified a strain that exhibited on average a 10-fold decrease in colonization levels relative to that achieved by wild-type V. fischeri. Further characterization revealed that this defect did not result from reduced luminescence or motility, two processes required for normal colonization. We determined that the transposon in this mutant disrupted a gene with high sequence identity to the pgm (phosphoglucomutase) gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes an enzyme that functions in both galactose metabolism and the synthesis of UDP-glucose. The V. fischeri mutant grew poorly with galactose as a sole carbon source and was defective for phosphoglucomutase activity, suggesting functional identity between E. coli Pgm and the product of the V. fischeri gene, which was therefore designated pgm. In addition, lipopolysaccharide profiles of the mutant were distinct from that of the parent strain and the mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to various cationic agents and detergents. Chromosomal complementation with the wild-type pgm allele restored the colonization ability to the mutant and also complemented the other noted defects. Unlike the pgm mutant, a galactose-utilization mutant (galK) of V. fischeri colonized juvenile squid to wild-type levels, indicating that the symbiotic defect of the pgm mutant is not due to an inability to catabolize galactose.

When grown in culture, cells of V. fischeri strain PMF8, in which litR was insertionally inactivated, were delayed in the onset of luminescence induction and emitted only about 20% as much light per cell as its parent. Protein-binding studies suggested that LitR enhances quorum sensing by regulating the transcription of the luxR gene. Interestingly, when competed against its parent in mixed inocula, PMF8 became the predominant symbiont present in 83% of light organs.

The mechanisms that promote this specific, cooperative colonization are likely to require a number of bacterial and host-derived factors and activities, only some of which have been described to date. A characteristic of many host-pathogen associations is the presence of bacterial mechanisms that allow attachment to specific tissues. These mechanisms have been well characterized and often involve bacterial fimbriae or outer membrane proteins (OMPs) that act as adhesins, the expression of which has been linked to virulence regulators such as ToxR in Vibrio cholerae. Analogous or even homologous mechanisms are probably operative in the initiation and persistence of cooperative bacterial associations, although considerably less is known about them. We report the presence in V. fischeri of ompU, a gene encoding a 32.5-kDa protein homolog of two other OMPs, OmpU of V. cholerae (50.8% amino acid sequence identity) and OmpL of Photobacterium profundum (45.5% identity). A null mutation introduced into the V. fischeri ompU resulted in the loss of an OMP with an estimated molecular mass of about 34 kDa; genetic complementation of the mutant strain with a DNA fragment containing only the ompU gene restored the production of this protein. The expression of the V. fischeri OmpU was not significantly affected by either (i) iron or phosphate limitation or (ii) a mutation that renders V. fischeri defective in the synthesis of a homolog of the OMP-regulatory protein ToxR. The ompU mutant grew normally in complex nutrient media but was more susceptible to growth inhibition in the presence of either anionic detergents or the antimicrobial peptide protamine sulfate. Interestingly, colonization experiments showed that the ompU null mutant initiated a symbiotic association with juvenile light organ tissue with only about 60% of the effectiveness of the parent strain. When colonization did occur, it proceeded more slowly and resulted in an approximately fourfold-smaller bacterial population. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that in a mixed infection with its parent, the ompU-defective strain had a competitive disadvantage, suggesting that the presence of the parent strain provided a shared compensatory activity. Thus, the OmpU protein appears to play a role in the normal process by which V. fischeri initiates its colonization of the nascent light organ of juvenile squids.",11673429

This mutant was not defective in motility, luminescence, or growth in minimal medium, suggesting that it lacks an essential, previously unidentified symbiotic function. By sequence analysis, we showed that the locus inactivated in this mutant encodes a predicted 927-amino-acid protein with a high degree of similarity to the sensor component of hybrid two-component regulatory systems. We have therefore designated this locus rscS, for regulator of symbiotic colonization-sensor. Sequence analysis revealed two hydrophobic regions which may result in the formation of a periplasmic loop involved in signal recognition; PhoA fusion data supported this proposed membrane topology. We have investigated the start site of rscS transcription by primer extension and identified a putative promoter region. We hypothesize that RscS recognizes a signal associated with the light organ environment and responds by stimulating a putative response regulator that controls protein function or gene expression to coordinate early colonization events.

Four lines of evidence indicate that HvnA and HvnB mediate polyarginine ADP-ribosylation not by ARTase activity, but indirectly through an NAD(+)-glycohydrolase (NADase) activity that releases free, reactive, ADP-ribose: (i) like other NADases, and in contrast to the ARTase cholera toxin, HvnA and HvnB catalyzed ribosylation of not only polyarginine but also polylysine and polyhistidine, and ribosylation was inhibited by hydroxylamine; (ii) HvnA and HvnB cleaved 1, N(6)-etheno-NAD(+) and NAD(+); (iii) incubation of HvnA and HvnB with [(32)P]NAD(+) resulted in the production of ADP-ribose; and (iv) purified HvnA displayed an NADase V(max) of 400 mol min(-1) mol(-1), which is within the range reported for other NADases and 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold higher than the minor NADase activity reported in bacterial ARTase toxins. Construction and analysis of an hvnA hvnB mutant revealed no other NADase activity in culture supernatants of V. fischeri, and this mutant initiated the light organ symbiosis and triggered regression of the light organ ciliated epithelium in a manner similar to that for the wild type.",11114931

In this study, we investigated the role in this process of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial cell-surface molecule implicated in the induction of animal cell apoptosis in other systems. Purified V. fischeri LPS, as well as the LPS of V. cholerae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Shigella flexneri, added in the concentration range of pg/ml to ng/ml, induced apoptosis in epithelial cells 10- to 100-fold above background levels. The absence of species specificity suggested that the conserved lipid A portion of the LPS was the responsible component of the LPS molecule. Lipid A from V. fischeri, E. coli, or S. flexneri induced apoptosis. In addition, strains of H. influenzae carrying a mutation in the htrB gene, which is involved in the synthesis of virulent lipid A, showed a diminished ability to induce apoptosis of host cells. Confocal microscopy using fluorescently labeled LPS indicated that the LPS behaves similar to intact bacterial symbionts, interacting with host cells in the internal crypt spaces and not directly with the superficial epithelium. Although LPS was able to induce apoptosis, it did not induce the full morphogenesis of the ciliated surface, suggesting that multiple signals are necessary to mediate the development of this animal-bacterial mutualism.",11023684

Upon entering the nascent light organ of a newly hatched juvenile squid, the bacteria undergo morphological and physiological changes that include the loss of flagellation and the induction of bioluminescence. These and other events reveal a pattern of genetic regulation that is a response to the colonization of host tissue. In this study, we isolated and characterized a glnD:mTn5Cm mutant of V. fischeri. In addition to the predicted defects in the efficiency of nitrogen utilization, this glnD mutant had an unexpected reduction in the ability to produce siderophore and grow under iron-limiting conditions. Although the glnD mutant could colonize juvenile squid normally over the first 24 h, it was subsequently unable to persist in the light organ to the usual extent. This persistence phenotype was more severe if the mutant was pregrown under iron-limiting conditions before inoculation, but could be ameliorated by the presence of excess iron. These results indicate that the ability to respond to iron limitation may be an important requirement in the developing symbiosis. Supplying the glnD gene in trans restored normal efficiency of nitrogen use, iron sequestration and colonization phenotypes to the glnD:mTn5Cm mutant; thus, there appears to be a genetic and/or metabolic linkage between nitrogen sensing, siderophore synthesis and symbiosis competence in V. fischeri that involves the glnD gene.",10931314

To identify quorum-sensing-regulated (QSR) proteins different from those encoded by lux genes, we examined the protein patterns of V. fischeri quorum-sensing mutants defective in luxI, ainS, and luxR by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five non-Lux QSR proteins, QsrP, RibB, AcfA, QsrV, and QSR 7, were identified; their production occurred preferentially at high population density, required both LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL, and was inhibited by C8-HSL at low population density. The genes encoding two of the QSR proteins were characterized: qsrP directs cells to synthesize an apparently novel periplasmic protein, and ribB is a homolog of the Escherichia coli gene for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase, a key enzyme for riboflavin synthesis. The qsrP and ribB promoter regions each contained a sequence similar to the lux operon lux box, a 20-bp region of dyad symmetry necessary for LuxR/3-oxo-C6-HSL-dependent activation of lux operon transcription. V. fischeri qsrP and ribB mutants exhibited no distinct phenotype in culture. However, a qsrP mutant, in competition with its parent strain, was less successful in colonizing Euprymna scolopes, the symbiotic host of V. fischeri. The newly identified QSR genes, together with the lux operon, define a LuxR/acyl-HSL-responsive quorum-sensing regulon in V. fischeri.",10781550

The association between the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the sepiolid squid Euprymna scolopes provides an experimental model for the study of the influence of extracellular bacteria on the development of host epithelia. In this study, we analyzed bacterium-induced changes in the brush borders of the light organ crypt epithelia during the initial hours following colonization of this tissue. Transmission electron microscopy of the brush border morphology in colonized and uncolonized hosts revealed that the bacteria effect a fourfold increase in microvillar density over the first 4 days of the association. Estimates of the proportions of bacterial cells in contact with host microvilli showed that the intimacy of the bacterial cells with animal cell surfaces increases significantly during this time. Antibiotic curing of the organ following colonization showed that sustained interaction with bacteria is essential for the retention of the induced morphological changes. Bacteria that are defective in either light production or colonization efficiency produced changes similar to those by the parent strain. Conventional fluorescence and confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that the brush border is supported by abundant filamentous actin. However, in situ hybridization with beta-actin probes did not show marked bacterium-induced increases in beta-actin gene expression. These experiments demonstrate that the E. scolopes-V. fischeri system is a viable model for the experimental study of bacterium-induced changes in host brush border morphology.",9453641
"""Euprymna scolopes"" AND ""Vibrio fischeri"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""",A peroxidase related to the mammalian antimicrobial protein myeloperoxidase in the Euprymna-Vibrio mutualism.,"Many animal-bacteria cooperative associations occur in highly modified host organs that create a unique environment for housing and maintaining the symbionts. It has been assumed that these specialized organs develop through a program of symbiosis-specific or -enhanced gene expression in one or both partners, but a clear example of this process has been lacking. In this study, we provide evidence for the enhanced production of an enzyme in the symbiotic organ of the squid Euprymna scolopes, which harbors a culture of the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Our data show that this enzyme has a striking biochemical similarity to mammalian myeloperoxidase (MPO; EC 1.11.17), an antimicrobial dianisidine peroxidase that occurs in neutrophils. MPO and the squid peroxidase catalyze the same reaction, have similar apparent subunit molecular masses, and a polyclonal antibody to native human MPO specifically localized a peroxidase-like protein to the bacteria-containing regions of the symbiotic organ. We also provide evidence that a previously described squid cDNA encodes the protein (LO4) that is responsible for the observed dianisidine peroxidase activity. An antibody made against a fragment of LO4 immunoprecipiated dianisidine peroxidase activity from extracts of the symbiotic organ, and reacted against these extracts and human MPO in Western blot analysis. These data suggest that related biochemical mechanisms for the control of bacterial number and growth operate in associations that are as functionally diverse as pathogenesis and mutualism, and as phylogenetically distant as molluscs and mammals.",8942994

Investigation of the genetic determinants underlying bacterial symbiotic competence in this system has necessitated the continuing establishment and application of molecular genetic techniques in V. fischeri. We developed a procedure for the introduction of plasmid DNA into V. fischeri by electroporation, and isolated a mutant strain that overcame the apparent restriction barrier between V. fischeri and Escherichia coli. Using the technique of electroporation in combination with that of gene replacement, we constructed a non-luminous strain of V. fischeri (delta luxA::erm). In addition, we used the transducing phage rp-1 for the first time to transfer a chromosomal antibiotic resistance marker to another strain of V. fischeri. The luxA mutant was able to colonize E. scolopes as quickly and to the same extent as wild type. This result suggested that, at least during the initial stages of colonization, luminescence per se is not an essential factor for the symbiotic infection.",8917081

This benign infection occurs rapidly in animals placed in seawater from the host's natural habitat. Therefore, it was surprising that colony hybridization studies with a V. fischeri-specific luxA gene probe indicated the presence of only about 2 CFU of V. fischeri per ml of this infective seawater. To examine this paradox, we estimated the total concentration of V. fischeri cells present in seawater from the host's habitat in two additional ways. In the first approach, the total bacterial assemblage in samples of seawater was collected on polycarbonate membrane filters and used as a source of both a crude cell lysate and purified DNA. These preparations were then assayed by quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization with the luxA gene probe. The results suggested the presence of between 200 and 400 cells of V. fischeri per ml of natural seawater, a concentration more than 100 times that revealed by colony hybridization. In the second approach, we amplified V. fischeri-specific luxA sequences from microliter volumes of natural seawater by PCR. Most-probable-number analyses of the frequency of positive PCR results from cell lysates in these small volumes gave an estimate of the concentration of V. fischeri luxA gene targets of between 130 and 1,680 copies per ml. From these measurements, we conclude that in their natural seawater environment, the majority of V. fischeri cells become nonculturable while remaining viable and symbiotically infective. Experimental studies indicated that V. fischeri cells suspended in natural Hawaiian seawater enter such a state within a few days.",16534910

"""bobtail squid"" AND ""bioluminescence"" AND ""symbiosis"" AND ""gene""","The novel sigma factor-like regulator RpoQ controls luminescence, chitinase activity, and motility in Vibrio fischeri.","Vibrio fischeri, the bacterial symbiont of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, uses quorum sensing to control genes involved in bioluminescence, host colonization, and other biological processes. Previous work has shown that AinS/R-directed quorum sensing also regulates the expression of rpoQ (VF_A1015), a gene annotated as an RpoS-like sigma factor. In this study, we demonstrate using phylogenetics that RpoQ is related to, but distinct from, the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. Overexpression of rpoQ results in elevated chitinase activity but decreased motility and luminescence, three activities associated with symbiosis. The reduction in bacterial luminescence associated with the overexpression of rpoQ occurs both in culture and within the light-emitting organ of the squid host. This suppression of bioluminescence is due to the repression of the luxICDABEG promoter. Our results highlight RpoQ as a novel regulatory component, embedded in the quorum-signaling network that controls several biological processes in V. fischeri. Quorum signaling is a widely occurring phenomenon that functions in diverse bacterial taxa. It is most often found associated with species that interact with animal or plant hosts, either as mutualists or pathogens, and controls the expression of genes critical to tissue colonization. We present the discovery of rpoQ, which encodes a new regulatory component in the quorum-signaling pathway of Vibrio fischeri. RpoQ is a novel protein in the RpoS family of stationary-phase sigma factors. Unlike many other regulatory proteins involved in the quorum-signaling pathways of the Vibrionaceae, the distribution of RpoQ appears to be restricted to only two closely related species. The role of this regulator is to enhance some quorum-signaling outputs (motility) while suppressing others (luminescence). We propose that RpoQ may be a recently evolved or acquired component in V. fischeri that provides this organism with an additional level of regulation to modulate its existing quorum-signaling pathway.",22233679
